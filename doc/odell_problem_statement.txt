CSE 5344 Students –

 

Following is the list of final project topics for this course.  Projects should be completed
and submitted by teams of 3 or 4 students (group effort).   Each team may select any one of
the topics shown below.  The intent of these projects is to provide you with an opportunity
to use what we have studied in this course but to go beyond the topics that we have discussed
in the classroom.  Each project requires research, analysis, critical thinking, and
modeling/experimenting, then documentation of your findings in a paper that could be submitted
for a conference.

 

Create your own teams, select your topic and let me know what you are working own and who is
on the team via email by 11/4/13.  One email per team is fine.  If you would like to propose
an alternative project, please send me a description before 11/1/13, that describes the project
and names team members.

 

TOPIC 1:  A BETTER UDP

 

A more TCP-like UDP.    Much work has been done, and documents in RFCs, to define a faster,
better TCP.    The challenge is that with the current model, and the services provided, a
penalty is incurred in overhead and performance.   Some studies address introducing a better
UDP protocol that provides some of the more essential TCP services, like reliable data transfer.
One approach considers error-correcting codes built on top of UDP to provide the reliability
and in-order delivery of TCP but with speed closer to that of UDP. 

 

For this project you will investigate current literature on a "better UDP" and propose a
protocol that implements "TCP-like" improvements, with much lower packet processing overhead.
Consider implementation as an enhancement that will maintain compatibility with standard UDP
implementations.   Demonstrate/validate your protocol's operation and your assertions by
implementing a packet processing model in a programming language/environment of your choice.
Write up your proposal in a paper, prepared for submission in IEEE paper format
(http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html. 

 

 

TOPIC 2: A BETTER TCP

 

As the Internet has matured in terms of the way applications use it and our understanding of
some of its limitations, it has become apparent that TCP is not ideally suited in many
circumstances.  As a result, there are several evolving proposals that are under review
and proposed as standards.  One such proposal is Stream Control Transmission Protocol as
defined in RFC 3286 and RFC 4960.  Another proposed standard, TCP Friendly Rate Control
(RFC 5348) deals with improved mechanisms for congestion control.

 

For this project you will investigate current literature on improvements to TCP and
evaluate them with respect to their viability in today's Internet.  Consider issues
such as performance, packet overhead, processing overhead and application interface
specifications.   Evaluate impact on existing and new applications and discuss the
feasibility of transition to the new approach(es) by Internet application/content
providers.   Demonstrate/validate your findings by implementing your packet processing
model or models in a programming language/environment of your choice.   Write up your
findings in a paper, prepared for submission in IEEE paper format
(http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html). 

 

 

TOPIC 3: A BETTER IP

 

IETF literature contains much information and numerous proposals for improving IP with
ATM-like enhancements since modern Internet applications demand services not provided by a
best-effort service model.   Two complementary, yet fundamentally different, traffic management
frameworks have evolved: Integrated Services and Differentiated Services (also see K&R textbook,
Chapter 7).  These approaches specify traffic control mechanisms such as queuing discipline
and packet discard policy to ensure more reliable bandwidth assurance for applications that need it. 

 

For this project you will investigate current literature on the Internet's network layer
protocols/architectures focused on improved quality of service and evaluate the pros and
cons of each approach.  Demonstrate/validate your findings and your assertions by implementing
a packet processing model in a programming language/environment of your choice.   Write up your
findings in a paper, prepared for submission in IEEE paper format
(http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html). 

 

 

TOPIC 4: REAL TIME FOR THE INTERNET

 

The Internet's Real Time Protocol (RTP, per RFC 3550) provides a standard approach for dealing
with audio and video data transferred between applications that require special handling.
Applications such a VoIP, streaming media, television and videoconferencing use RTP for data
delivery.

 

For this project you will investigate current literature on the Internet's Real Time Protocol
and evaluate its strengths and weaknesses for "real time" operation in a packet switched network.
Demonstrate/validate your findings and your assertions by implementing an application that uses
and models the Real Time Protocol in a programming language/environment of your choice.   Write
up your findings in a paper, prepared for submission in IEEE paper format 
(http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html).
