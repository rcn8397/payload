< 
< Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.
< The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the
< undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name
< was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old
< Marley was as dead as a door-nail.
< 
< Mind! I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is
< particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,
< to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the
< trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my
< unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You
< will, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as
< dead as a door-nail.
< 
< Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?
< Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge
< was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole
< residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge
< was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an
< excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised
< it with an undoubted bargain.
< 
< The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started
< from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly
< understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to
< relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died
< before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his
< taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,
< than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning
< out after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul's Churchyard, for
< instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.
< 
< Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years
< afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was
< known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called
< Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It
< was all the same to him.
< 
< Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a
< squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old
< sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out
< generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.
< The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,
< shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin
< lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime
< was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his
< own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the
< dog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.
< 
< External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could
< warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than
< he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain
< less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The
< heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the
< advantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down'
< handsomely, and Scrooge never did.
< 
< Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My
< dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars
< implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was
< o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to
< such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to
< know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into
< doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they
< said, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'
< 
< But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his
< way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep
< its distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge.
< 
< Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas
< Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,
< biting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court
< outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,
< and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City
< clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had
< not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the
< neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The
< fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense
< without, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses
< opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,
< obscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,
< and was brewing on a large scale.
< 
< The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he might keep his
< eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,
< was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire
< was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't
< replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so
< surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that
< it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his
< white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which
< effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.
< 
< 'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was
< the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this
< was the first intimation he had of his approach.
< 
< 'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'
< 
< He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this
< nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and
< handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.
< 
< 'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean
< that, I am sure?'
< 
< 'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?
< What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'
< 
< 'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be
< dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'
< 
< Scrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,
< 'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'
< 
< 'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.
< 
< 'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world
< of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's
< Christmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time
< for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for
< balancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen
< of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,' said
< Scrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"
< on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a
< stake of holly through his heart. He should!'
< 
< 'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew.
< 
< 'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way,
< and let me keep it in mine.'
< 
< 'Keep it!' repeated Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't keep it.'
< 
< 'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge. 'Much good may it do you!
< Much good it has ever done you!'
< 
< 'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I
< have not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among
< the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when
< it has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and
< origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good
< time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know
< of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one
< consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people
< below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and
< not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,
< uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I
< believe that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God

< 
< It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous
< word 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the
< credentials back.
< 
< 'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,
< taking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make
< some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at
< the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;
< hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'
< 
< 'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.
< 
< 'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.
< 
< 'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in
< operation?'
< 
< 'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were
< not.'
< 
< 'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.
< 
< 'Both very busy, sir.'
< 
< 'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had
< occurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very
< glad to hear it.'
< 
< 'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind
< or body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are
< endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and
< means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all
< others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I
< put you down for?'
< 
< 'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.
< 
< 'You wish to be anonymous?'
< 
< 'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,
< gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,
< and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the
< establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are
< badly off must go there.'
< 
< 'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'
< 
< 'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and
< decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'
< 
< 'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.
< 
< 'It's not my business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to
< understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.
< Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'
< 
< Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the
< gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion
< of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.
< 
< Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with
< flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in
< carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,
< whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a
< Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and
< quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its
< teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became
< intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers
< were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,
< round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their
< hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug
< being left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned
< to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and
< berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy
< as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:
< a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that
< such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord
< Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his
< fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household
< should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on
< the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,
< stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and

< The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,

< separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be
< frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,
< and up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.
< 
< You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight

< you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,
< with the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the

< you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.
< 
< Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and
< Scrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through
< his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of
< the face to desire to do that.
< 
< Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under
< the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and
< basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his
< head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody
< in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude
< against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two
< fish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.
< 
< [Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in
< his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against
< the wall_]
< 
< Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double
< locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against
< surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,
< and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.
< 
< It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was
< obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract
< the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace
< was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all
< round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.
< There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba,
< Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like
< feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in
< butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that
< face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,
< and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at
< first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the
< disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of
< old Marley's head on every one.
< 
< 'Humbug!' said Scrooge; and walked across the room.
< 
< After several turns he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the
< chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that
< hung in the room, and communicated, for some purpose now forgotten, with
< a chamber in the highest storey of the building. It was with great
< astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that, as he
< looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the
< outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and
< so did every bell in the house.
< 
< This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an
< hour. The bells ceased, as they had begun, together. They were succeeded
< by a clanking noise deep down below as if some person were dragging a
< heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant's cellar. Scrooge then
< remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as
< dragging chains.
< 
< The cellar door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the
< noise much louder on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then
< coming straight towards his door.
< 
< 'It's humbug still!' said Scrooge. 'I won't believe it.'
< 
< His colour changed, though, when, without a pause, it came on through
< the heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming
< in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, 'I know him! Marley's
< Ghost!' and fell again.
< 
< The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat,
< tights, and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his
< pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he
< drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like
< a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes,
< keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His
< body was transparent: so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking
< through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.
< 
< Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had
< never believed it until now.
< 
< No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through
< and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling
< influence of its death-cold eyes, and marked the very texture of the
< folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not
< observed before, he was still incredulous, and fought against his
< senses.

< 
< 'You were always a good friend to me,' said Scrooge. 'Thankee!'

< 
< Scrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost's had done.

< 
< 'It is.'
< 
< 'I--I think I'd rather not,' said Scrooge.

< 
< [Illustration: _The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and

<

< the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.
<

< out.
< 
< The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in
< restless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains
< like Marley's Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were
< linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to
< Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost in
< a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who
< cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an
< infant, whom it saw below upon a doorstep. The misery with them all was
< clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and
< had lost the power for ever.
< 
< Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he
< could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and
< the night became as it had been when he walked home.
< 
< Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had
< entered. It was double locked, as he had locked it with his own hands,
< and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say 'Humbug!' but stopped at
< the first syllable. And being, from the emotions he had undergone, or
< the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the
< dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in
< need of repose, went straight to bed without undressing, and fell asleep

< He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep,

<

< face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as
< I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.
< 
< It was a strange figure--like a child; yet not so like a child as like
< an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the
< appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a
< child's proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its
< back, was white, as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in
< it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and
< muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength.
< Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper

< branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction

< the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there
< sprang a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and
< which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a
< great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.
< 
< Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness,
< was _not_ its strangest quality. For, as its belt sparkled and
< glittered, now in one part and now in another, and what was light one
< instant at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its
< distinctness; being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with
< twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a
< body: of which dissolving parts no outline would be visible in the dense
< gloom wherein they melted away. And, in the very wonder of this, it

< 'Who and what are you?' Scrooge demanded.
< 
< 'I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.'
< 
< 'Long Past?' inquired Scrooge, observant of its dwarfish stature.
< 
< 'No. Your past.'
< 
< Perhaps Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have
< asked him; but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his cap,
< and begged him to be covered.
< 
< 'What!' exclaimed the Ghost, 'would you so soon put out, with worldly
< hands, the light I give? Is it not enough that you are one of those
< whose passions made this cap, and force me through whole trains of years
< to wear it low upon my brow?'
< 
< Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge
< of having wilfully 'bonneted' the Spirit at any period of his life. He
< then made bold to inquire what business brought him there.
< 
< 'Your welfare!' said the Ghost.
< 
< Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that
< a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end. The
< Spirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately--
< 
< 'Your reclamation, then. Take heed!'
< 
< It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the
< arm.
< 
< 'Rise! and walk with me!'
< 
< It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the
< hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the
< thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in
< his slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon
< him at that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand, was not
< to be resisted. He rose; but, finding that the Spirit made towards the
< window, clasped its robe in supplication.
< 
< 'I am a mortal,' Scrooge remonstrated, 'and liable to fall.'
< 
< 'Bear but a touch of my hand _there_,' said the Spirit, laying it upon
< his heart, 'and you shall be upheld in more than this!'
< 
< As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon
< an open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely
< vanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist
< had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow
< upon the ground.
< 
< 'Good Heaven!' said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he looked
< about him. 'I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!'
< 
< The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been
< light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man's sense
< of feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air,
< each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and
< cares long, long forgotten!
< 
< 'Your lip is trembling,' said the Ghost. 'And what is that upon your
< cheek?'
< 
< Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a
< pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.
< 
< 'You recollect the way?' inquired the Spirit.
< 
< 'Remember it!' cried Scrooge with fervour; 'I could walk it blindfold.'
< 
< 'Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!' observed the Ghost.
< 'Let us go on.'
< 
< They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post,
< and tree, until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its
< bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen
< trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other
< boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were
< in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were
< so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it.
< 
< 'These are but shadows of the things that have been,' said the Ghost.
< 'They have no consciousness of us.'
< 
< The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named
< them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them? Why
< did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past? Why
< was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry
< Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and by-ways for their several
< homes? What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas!
< What good had it ever done to him?
< 
< 'The school is not quite deserted,' said the Ghost. 'A solitary child,
< neglected by his friends, is left there still.'
< 
< Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.
< 
< They left the high-road by a well-remembered lane and soon approached a
< mansion of dull red brick, with a little weather-cock surmounted cupola
< on the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of
< broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls
< were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed.
< Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and
< sheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient
< state within; for, entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the
< open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and
< vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the
< place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by
< candle light and not too much to eat.
< 
< They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back
< of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare,
< melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and
< desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and
< Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as
< he had used to be.
< 
< Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice
< behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed waterspout in the
< dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent
< poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door, no, not a
< clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with softening
< influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.
< 
< The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self,
< intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man in foreign garments, wonderfully
< real and distinct to look at, stood outside the window, with an axe
< stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.
< 
< 'Why, it's Ali Baba!' Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. 'It's dear old
< honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know. One Christmas-time, when yonder
< solitary child was left here all alone, he _did_ come, for the first
< time, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,' said Scrooge, 'and his
< wild brother, Orson; there they go! And what's his name, who was put
< down in his drawers, asleep, at the gate of Damascus; don't you see him?
< And the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon
< his head! Serve him right! I'm glad of it. What business had he to be
< married to the Princess?'

< 'There's the Parrot!' cried Scrooge. 'Green body and yellow tail, with a
< thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is!
< Poor Robin Crusoe he called him, when he came home again after sailing
< round the island. "Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin
< Crusoe?" The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't. It was the
< Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little
< creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!'
< 
< Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character,
< he said, in pity for his former self, 'Poor boy!' and cried again.
< 
< 'I wish,' Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking
< about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff; 'but it's too late now.'
< 
< 'What is the matter?' asked the Spirit.
< 
< 'Nothing,' said Scrooge. 'Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas
< carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something:
< that's all.'
< 
< The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand, saying as it did so,
< 'Let us see another Christmas!'
< 
< Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a
< little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;
< fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were
< shown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more
< than you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had
< happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had
< gone home for the jolly holidays.
< 
< He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge
< looked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced
< anxiously towards the door.
< 
< It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting
< in, and, putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him,
< addressed him as her 'dear, dear brother.'
< 
< 'I have come to bring you home, dear brother!' said the child, clapping
< her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. 'To bring you home, home,
< home!'
< 
< 'Home, little Fan?' returned the boy.
< 
< 'Yes!' said the child, brimful of glee. 'Home for good and all. Home for
< ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home's
< like heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to
< bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home;
< and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And
< you're to be a man!' said the child, opening her eyes; 'and are never to
< come back here; but first we're to be together all the Christmas long,
< and have the merriest time in all the world.'
< 
< 'You are quite a woman, little Fan!' exclaimed the boy.
< 
< She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but,
< being too little laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then
< she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and
< he, nothing loath to go, accompanied her.
< 
< A terrible voice in the hall cried, 'Bring down Master Scrooge's box,
< there!' and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on
< Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a
< dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him
< and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour
< that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and
< terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced
< a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake,
< and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people; at
< the same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of
< 'something' to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,
< but, if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not.
< Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the
< chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly;
< and, getting into it, drove gaily down the garden sweep; the quick
< wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the
< evergreens like spray.
<

< 
< 'Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,' said
< the Ghost. 'But she had a large heart!'
< 
< 'So she had,' cried Scrooge. 'You're right. I will not gainsay it,
< Spirit. God forbid!'
< 
< 'She died a woman,' said the Ghost, 'and had, as I think, children.'
< 
< 'One child,' Scrooge returned.
< 
< 'True,' said the Ghost. 'Your nephew!'
< 
< Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind, and answered briefly, 'Yes.'

< Although they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were
< now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed

< again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.
< 
< The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he
< knew it.
< 
< 'Know it!' said Scrooge. 'Was I apprenticed here?'
< 
< They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting
< behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller, he must
< have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great
< excitement--
< 
< 'Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart, it's Fezziwig alive again!'
< 
< Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which
< pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his
< capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his
< organ of benevolence; and called out, in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat,
< jovial voice--
< 
< 'Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!'
< 
< Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in,
< accompanied by his fellow-'prentice.
< 
< 'Dick Wilkins, to be sure!' said Scrooge to the Ghost. 'Bless me, yes.
< There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear,
< dear!'
< 
< 'Yo ho, my boys!' said Fezziwig. 'No more work to-night. Christmas Eve,
< Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's have the shutters up,' cried old
< Fezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, 'before a man can say Jack
< Robinson!'
< 
< You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into
< the street with the shutters--one, two, three--had 'em up in their
< places--four, five, six--barred 'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight,
< nine--and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like
< racehorses.
< 
< 'Hilli-ho!' cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk with
< wonderful agility. 'Clear away, my lads, and let's have lots of room
< here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!'
< 
< Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away, or
< couldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in
< a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from
< public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps
< were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as
< snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room as you would desire to
< see upon a winter's night.
< 
< In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and
< made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came
< Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss
< Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose
< hearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the
< business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin the baker. In came the
< cook with her brother's particular friend the milkman. In came the boy
< from over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his
< master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one,
< who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all
< came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some
< awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, any how and
< every how. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round
< and back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and
< round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always
< turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again as soon
< as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help
< them! When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his
< hands to stop the dance, cried out, 'Well done!' and the fiddler plunged
< his hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose.
< But, scorning rest upon his reappearance, he instantly began again,
< though there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been
< carried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man
< resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.
< 
< [Illustration: _Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs.
< Fezziwig_]
< 
< There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and
< there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold
< Roast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were
< mince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came
< after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The
< sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told
< it him!) struck up 'Sir Roger de Coverley.' Then old Fezziwig stood
< out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff
< piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of
< partners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would
< dance, and had no notion of walking.
< 
< But if they had been twice as many--ah! four times--old Fezziwig would
< have been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to _her_, she
< was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that's not
< high praise, tell me higher, and I'll use it. A positive light appeared
< to issue from Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part of the dance
< like moons. You couldn't have predicted, at any given time, what would
< become of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone
< all through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner,
< bow and curtsy, cork-screw, thread-the-needle, and back again to your
< place: Fezziwig 'cut'--cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his
< legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.
< 
< When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs.
< Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side the door, and, shaking
< hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him
< or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two
< 'prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died
< away, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter
< in the back-shop.
< 
< During the whole of this time Scrooge had acted like a man out of his
< wits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He
< corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and
< underwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright
< faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he
< remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon
< him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.

<

< and avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye,
< which showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of

< 
< He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning

< young girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same,
< until he saw _her_, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter.

< mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most

< never could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn't for the wealth of all
< the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the
< precious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul!

< young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should have expected my arm to
< have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And
< yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have

< lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose
< waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in

< purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to
< him through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he turned
< uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this
< new spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own
< hands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the
< bed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its
< appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.
< 
< Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being
< acquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of
< day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing
< that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter;
< between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide
< and comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite
< as hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was
< ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing
< between a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.
< 
< Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means
< prepared for nothing; and consequently, when the bell struck One, and no
< shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five
< minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.
< All this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze
< of ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the
< hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen
< ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;
< and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an
< interesting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the
< consolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you
< or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the
< predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would
< unquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that
< the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining
< room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea
< taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly, and shuffled in
< his slippers to the door.
< 
< The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by
< his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.
< 
< It was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone
< a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with
< living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which
< bright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,
< and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been
< scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as
< that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time,
< or Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the
< floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,
< brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,
< mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,
< cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense
< twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim
< with their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there sat a
< jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not
< unlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on
< Scrooge as he came peeping round the door.
< 
< 'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'Come in! and know me better, man!'
< 
< Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was
< not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were
< clear and kind, he did not like to meet them.
< 
< 'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit. 'Look upon me!'
< 
< Scrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple deep green robe,
< or mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the
< figure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be
< warded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the
< ample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no
< other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining
< icicles. Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial
< face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its
< unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was
< an antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was
< eaten up with rust.
< 
< 'You have never seen the like of me before!' exclaimed the Spirit.
< 
< 'Never,' Scrooge made answer to it.
< 
< 'Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning
< (for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?'
< pursued the Phantom.
< 
< 'I don't think I have,' said Scrooge. 'I am afraid I have not. Have you
< had many brothers, Spirit?'
< 
< 'More than eighteen hundred,' said the Ghost.
< 
< 'A tremendous family to provide for,' muttered Scrooge.
< 
< The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.
< 
< 'Spirit,' said Scrooge submissively, 'conduct me where you will. I went
< forth last night on compulsion, and I learned a lesson which is working
< now. To-night if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.'
< 
< 'Touch my robe!'
< 
< Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.
< 
< Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry,
< brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch,
< all vanished instantly. So did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow, the
< hour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning,
< where (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk
< and not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the pavement
< in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of their houses, whence
< it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the
< road below, and splitting into artificial little snowstorms.
< 
< The house-fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker,
< contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with
< the dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been ploughed
< up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons: furrows
< that crossed and recrossed each other hundreds of times where the great
< streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace in the
< thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy, and the shortest
< streets were choked up with a dingy mist, half thawed, half frozen,
< whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all
< the chimneys in Great Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were
< blazing away to their dear heart's content. There was nothing very
< cheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of
< cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer
< sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.
< 
< [Illustration: THERE WAS NOTHING VERY CHEERFUL IN THE CLIMATE]
< 
< For the people who were shovelling away on the house-tops were jovial
< and full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, and now
< and then exchanging a facetious snowball--better-natured missile far
< than many a wordy jest--laughing heartily if it went right, and not less
< heartily if it went wrong. The poulterers' shops were still half open,
< and the fruiterers' were radiant in their glory. There were great,
< round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of
< jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the
< street in their apoplectic opulence: There were ruddy, brown-faced,
< broad-girthed Spanish onions, shining in the fatness of their growth
< like Spanish friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at
< the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up
< mistletoe. There were pears and apples clustered high in blooming
< pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers'
< benevolence, to dangle from conspicuous hooks that people's mouths might
< water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and
< brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and
< pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were
< Norfolk Biffins, squab and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the
< oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy
< persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper
< bags and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth
< among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and
< stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going
< on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in
< slow and passionless excitement.
< 
< The Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters
< down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses! It was not alone
< that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that
< the twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters
< were rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended
< scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the
< raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the
< sticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious,
< the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the
< coldest lookers-on feel faint, and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that
< the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in
< modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything
< was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all
< so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they
< tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets
< wildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running
< back to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the
< best humour possible; while the grocer and his people were so frank and
< fresh, that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons
< behind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection,
< and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.
< 
< But soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel, and
< away they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes and
< with their gayest faces. And at the same time there emerged, from scores
< of by-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people,
< carrying their dinners to the bakers' shops. The sight of these poor
< revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with
< Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and, taking off the covers as
< their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch.
< And it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice, when there
< were angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each
< other, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their
< good-humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame to
< quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love it, so it was!
<

< 'To any kindly given. To a poor one most.'
< 
< 'Why to a poor one most?' asked Scrooge.
< 
< 'Because it needs it most.'
< 
< 'Spirit!' said Scrooge, after a moment's thought, 'I wonder you, of all
< the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these
< people's opportunities of innocent enjoyment.
< 
< 'I!' cried the Spirit.
< 
< 'You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day,
< often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all,' said
< Scrooge; 'wouldn't you?'
< 
< 'I!' cried the Spirit.
< 
< 'You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day,' said Scrooge. 'And
< it comes to the same thing.'
< 
< 'I seek!' exclaimed the Spirit.
< 
< 'Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at least in
< that of your family,' said Scrooge.
< 
< 'There are some upon this earth of yours,' returned the Spirit, 'who
< lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride,
< ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as
< strange to us, and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived.
< Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.'
< 
< Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on, invisible, as they had
< been before, into the suburbs of the town. It was a remarkable quality
< of the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker's), that
< notwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any
< place with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as
< gracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible he could
< have done in any lofty hall.
< 
< And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this
< power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and
< his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge's
< clerk's; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his
< robe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to
< bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinklings of his torch. Think
< of that! Bob had but fifteen 'Bob' a week himself; he pocketed on
< Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of
< Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!
< 
< Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in a
< twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap, and make a
< goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda
< Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master
< Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting
< the corners of his monstrous shirt-collar (Bob's private property,
< conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day,) into his mouth,
< rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his
< linen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and
< girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt
< the goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts
< of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and
< exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud,

< copper.
< 
< 'And how did little Tim behave?' asked Mrs. Cratchit when she had
< rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his
< heart's content.
< 
< 'As good as gold,' said Bob, 'and better. Somehow, he gets thoughtful,

< church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to

< 
< Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when
< he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.
< 
< His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny
< Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and
< sister to his stool beside the fire; and while Bob, turning up his
< cuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more
< shabby--compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and
< stirred it round and round, and put it on the hob to simmer, Master
< Peter and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose,
< with which they soon returned in high procession.
< 
< [Illustration]
< 
< Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of
< all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of
< course--and, in truth, it was something very like it in that house. Mrs.
< Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing
< hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss
< Belinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob
< took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young
< Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and,
< mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest
< they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At
< last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a
< breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the
< carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,
< and when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of
< delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two
< young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife and
< feebly cried Hurrah!
< 
< [Illustration: HE HAD BEEN TIM'S BLOOD-HORSE ALL THE WAY FROM CHURCH]
< 
< There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was
< such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness,
< were the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and
< mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;
< indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small
< atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every
< one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were
< steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being
< changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous
< to bear witnesses--to take the pudding up, and bring it in.
< 
< Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning
< out! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard and
< stolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which
< the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were
< supposed.
< 
< Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell
< like a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and
< a pastry-cook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to
< that! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit
< entered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled
< cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of
< ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.
< 
< Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he
< regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since
< their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the weight was off her
< mind, she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour.
< Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it
< was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat
< heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a
< thing.
< 
< [Illustration: WITH THE PUDDING]
< 
< At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth
< swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and
< considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a
< shovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family
< drew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half
< a one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.
< Two tumblers and a custard cup without a handle.
< 
< These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden
< goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while
< the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob
< proposed:
< 
< 'A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!'
<

< 
< 'Spirit,' said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, 'tell

< 
< 'I see a vacant seat,' replied the Ghost, 'in the poor chimney corner,
< and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows

< 
< 'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'
< 
< 'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'
< returned the Ghost, 'will find him here. What then? If he be like to
< die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.'
< 
< Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and
< was overcome with penitence and grief.
< 
< 'Man,' said the Ghost, 'if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear
< that wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is, and
< where it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It
< may be that, in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit
< to live than millions like this poor man's child. O God! to hear the
< insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry
< brothers in the dust!'
< 
< Scrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and, trembling, cast his eyes
< upon the ground. But he raised them speedily on hearing his own name.
< 
< 'Mr. Scrooge!' said Bob. 'I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the

< 
< 'The Founder of the Feast, indeed!' cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. 'I

< 
< 'My dear,' said Bob, 'the children! Christmas Day.'

< 'My dear!' was Bob's mild answer. 'Christmas Day.'
< 
< 'I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's,' said Mrs. Cratchit,
< 'not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
< He'll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!'
< 
< The children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their
< proceedings which had no heartiness in it. Tiny Tim drank it last of
< all, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the
< family. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which
< was not dispelled for full five minutes.
< 
< After it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before, from
< the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit
< told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which
< would bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two
< young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man
< of business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from
< between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular
< investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that
< bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's,
< then told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she
< worked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for
< a good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how
< she had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord
< 'was much about as tall as Peter'; at which Peter pulled up his collar
< so high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All
< this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-by
< they had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny
< Tim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.
< 
< There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family;
< they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being waterproof;
< their clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely
< did, the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy, grateful,
< pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they
< faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's
< torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny
< Tim, until the last.
< 
< By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as
< Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the
< roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms was
< wonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a
< cosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire,
< and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.
< There, all the children of the house were running out into the snow to
< meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the
< first to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of
< guests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and
< fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near
< neighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them
< enter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!
< 
< But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to
< friendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to
< give them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting
< company, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how
< the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its
< capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring with a generous hand its
< bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very
< lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of
< light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out
< loudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that
< he had any company but Christmas.
< 
< And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a
< bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast
< about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread
< itself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost
< that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse,
< rank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery
< red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,
< and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of
< darkest night.
< 
< 'What place is this?' asked Scrooge.
< 
< 'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,'
< returned the Spirit. 'But they know me. See!'
< 
< A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced
< towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a
< cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and
< woman, with their children and their children's children, and another
< generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.
< The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind
< upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a
< very old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined
< in the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got
< quite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank
< again.

< The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and,
< passing on above the moor, sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To
< Scrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful
< range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the
< thundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the
< dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.
< 
< Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,

< stood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base,
< and storm-birds--born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the
< water--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.
< 
< But, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that
< through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of
< brightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough
< table at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their
< can of grog; and one of them--the elder too, with his face all damaged
< and scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might
< be--struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.
< 
< Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until
< being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a
< ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the
< bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their
< several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or
< had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of
< some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And
< every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder

< She was very pretty; exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled,

< Altogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but
< satisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory!
< 
< 'He's a comical old fellow,' said Scrooge's nephew, 'that's the truth;
< and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry their
< own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.'
< 
< 'I'm sure he is very rich, Fred,' hinted Scrooge's niece. 'At least, you
< always tell _me_ so.'
< 
< 'What of that, my dear?' said Scrooge's nephew. 'His wealth is of no use
< to him. He don't do any good with it. He don't make himself comfortable
< with it. He hasn't the satisfaction of thinking--ha, ha, ha!--that he is
< ever going to benefit Us with it.'
< 
< 'I have no patience with him,' observed Scrooge's niece. Scrooge's
< niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.
< 
< 'Oh, I have!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'I am sorry for him; I couldn't be
< angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims? Himself always.
< Here he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won't come and dine
< with us. What's the consequence? He don't lose much of a dinner.'
< 
< 'Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,' interrupted Scrooge's
< niece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have
< been competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and with the
< dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.
< 
< 'Well! I am very glad to hear it,' said Scrooge's nephew, 'because I
< haven't any great faith in these young housekeepers. What do _you_ say,
< Topper?'
< 
< Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's sisters,
< for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right
< to express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge's niece's
< sister--the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the
< roses--blushed.
< 
< 'Do go on, Fred,' said Scrooge's niece, clapping her hands. 'He never
< finishes what he begins to say! He is such a ridiculous fellow!'
< 
< Scrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to
< keep the infection off, though the plump sister tried hard to do it with
< aromatic vinegar, his example was unanimously followed.
< 
< 'I was only going to say,' said Scrooge's nephew, 'that the consequence
< of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I
< think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm.
< I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own
< thoughts, either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers. I mean
< to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for
< I pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can't help
< thinking better of it--I defy him--if he finds me going there, in good
< temper, year after year, and saying, "Uncle Scrooge, how are you?" If it
< only put him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, _that's_
< something; and I think I shook him yesterday.'
< 
< It was their turn to laugh now, at the notion of his shaking Scrooge.
< But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed
< at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their
< merriment, and passed the bottle, joyously.
< 
< After tea they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew
< what they were about when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you:
< especially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and
< never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over
< it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and played, among other
< tunes, a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle
< it in two minutes) which had been familiar to the child who fetched
< Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost
< of Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things
< that Ghost had shown him came upon his mind; he softened more and more;
< and thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he
< might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with
< his own hands, without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob
< Marley.
< 
< [Illustration: _The way he went after that plump sister in the lace
< tucker!_]
< 
< But they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After a while they
< played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never
< better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself.
< Stop! There was first a game at blind man's-buff. Of course there was.
< And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes
< in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and
< Scrooge's nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The
< way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on
< the credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling
< over the chairs, bumping up against the piano, smothering himself
< amongst the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew
< where the plump sister was. He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had
< fallen up against him (as some of them did) on purpose, he would have
< made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an
< affront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in
< the direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn't
< fair; and it really was not. But when, at last, he caught her; when, in
< spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him,
< he got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct
< was the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his
< pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to
< assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her
< finger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No
< doubt she told him her opinion of it when, another blind man being in
< office, they were so very confidential together behind the curtains.
< 
< Scrooge's niece was not one of the blind man's-buff party, but was made
< comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner where
< the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the
< forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the
< alphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very
< great, and, to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat her sisters
< hollow; though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you.
< There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all
< played, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting, in the interest he
< had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he
< sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed
< right, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to
< cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge, blunt as he took it in
< his head to be.
< 
< The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon
< him with such favour that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay
< until the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done.
< 
< 'Here is a new game,' said Scrooge. 'One half-hour, Spirit, only one!'
< 
< It was a game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew had to think of
< something, and the rest must find out what, he only answering to their
< questions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of questioning to
< which he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an
< animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an
< animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes and
< lived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn't made a show
< of, and wasn't led by anybody, and didn't live in a menagerie, and was
< never killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a
< bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every
< fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar
< of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to
< get up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a
< similar state, cried out:
< 
< 'I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!'
< 
< 'What is it?' cried Fred.
< 
< 'It's your uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge.'
< 
< Which it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though
< some objected that the reply to 'Is it a bear?' ought to have been
< 'Yes'; inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have
< diverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had
< any tendency that way.
< 
< 'He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,' said Fred, 'and it
< would be ungrateful not to drink his health. Here is a glass of mulled
< wine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say, "Uncle Scrooge!"'
< 
< 'Well! Uncle Scrooge!' they cried.
< 
< 'A merry Christmas and a happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is!'
< said Scrooge's nephew. 'He wouldn't take it from me, but may he have it,
< nevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!'
< 
< Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that
< he would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked
< them in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the
< whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his
< nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.
< 
< Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but
< always with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick-beds, and they
< were cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by
< struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty,
< and it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and gaol, in misery's every

<

< 
< Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups.
< Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.
< 
< The phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons
< meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie
< here.
< 
< He knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business: very
< wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of standing
< well in their esteem in a business point of view, that is; strictly in a
< business point of view.
< 
< 'How are you?' said one.
< 
< 'How are you?' returned the other.
< 
< 'Well!' said the first, 'old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?'
< 
< 'So I am told,' returned the second. 'Cold, isn't it?'
< 
< 'Seasonable for Christmas-time. You are not a skater, I suppose?'
< 
< 'No, no. Something else to think of. Good-morning!'
< 
< Not another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their
< parting.
< 
< Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should
< attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling
< assured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to
< consider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to
< have any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was
< Past, and this Ghost's province was the Future. Nor could he think of
< any one immediately connected with himself to whom he could apply them.
< But nothing doubting that, to whomsoever they applied, they had some
< latent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every
< word he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the
< shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation that the
< conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would
< render the solution of these riddles easy.
< 
< He looked about in that very place for his own image, but another man
< stood in his accustomed corner; and though the clock pointed to his
< usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among
< the multitudes that poured in through the Porch. It gave him little
< surprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of
< life, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out
< in this.
< 
< Quiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched
< hand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied,
< from the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself,
< that the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder,
< and feel very cold.
< 
< They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town,
< where Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its
< situation and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shop
< and houses wretched; the people half naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly.
< Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of
< smell and dirt, and life upon the straggling streets; and the whole
< quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.
< 
< Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling
< shop, below a penthouse roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and
< greasy offal were bought. Upon the floor within were piled up heaps of
< rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse
< iron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred
< and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and
< sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a
< charcoal stove made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly
< seventy years of age, who had screened himself from the cold air without
< by a frouzy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line and
< smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.
< 
< Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a
< woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely
< entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was
< closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by
< the sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other.
< After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with
< the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.
< 
< 'Let the charwoman alone to be the first!' cried she who had entered
< first. 'Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the
< undertaker's man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here's a
< chance! If we haven't all three met here without meaning it!'
< 
< 'You couldn't have met in a better place,' said old Joe, removing his
< pipe from his mouth. 'Come into the parlour. You were made free of it
< long ago, you know; and the other two an't strangers. Stop till I shut
< the door of the shop. Ah! how it skreeks! There an't such a rusty bit of
< metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's no
< such old bones here as mine. Ha! ha! We're all suitable to our calling,
< we're well matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.'

<

< 
< 'I wish it was a little heavier judgment,' replied the woman: 'and it

< 
< But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in

< that there was nothing more to come.
<

< Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about
< their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man's lamp, he
< viewed them with a detestation and disgust which could hardly have been
< greater, though they had been obscene demons marketing the corpse
< itself.
< 
< 'Ha, ha!' laughed the same woman when old Joe producing a flannel bag
< with money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. 'This
< is the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away from him when he
< was alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!'
< 
< 'Spirit!' said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. 'I see, I see. The
< case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way now.
< Merciful heaven, what is this?'
< 
< He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now he almost
< touched a bed--a bare, uncurtained bed--on which, beneath a ragged
< sheet, there lay a something covered up, which, though it was dumb,
< announced itself in awful language.
< 
< The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy,
< though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse,
< anxious to know what kind of room it was. A pale light, rising in the
< outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft,
< unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.
< 
< Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the
< head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of
< it, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the
< face. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to
< do it; but he had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the
< spectre at his side.
< 
< Oh, cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and
< dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command; for this is thy
< dominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head thou canst not
< turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is
< not that the hand is heavy, and will fall down when released; it is not
< that the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand was open,
< generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender, and the pulse a
< man's. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from the
< wound, to sow the world with life immortal!
< 
< No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and yet he heard them
< when he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be raised up
< now, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard dealing, griping
< cares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly!
< 
< He lay in the dark, empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child to
< say he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind
< word I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was
< a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearthstone. What _they_ wanted in
< the room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge
< did not dare to think.
---

3010,3011c2692
< 'Spirit!' he said, 'this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not
< leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!'
---
> Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved iger o the head.
3013,3016c2694,2695
< Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.
< 
< 'I understand you,' Scrooge returned, 'and I would do it if I could. But
< I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.'
---

< 'If there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this
< man's death,' said Scrooge, quite agonised, 'show that person to me,
< Spirit, I beseech you!'
< 
< The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing;
< and, withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her
< children were.
< 
< She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked
< up and down the room, started at every sound, looked out from the
< window, glanced at the clock, tried, but in vain, to work with her
< needle, and could hardly bear the voices of her children in their play.
< 
< At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door,
< and met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though
< he was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now, a kind of
< serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to
< repress.
< 
< He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire,
< and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a
< long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.
< 
< 'Is it good,' she said, 'or bad?' to help him.
< 
< 'Bad,' he answered.
< 
< 'We are quite ruined?'
< 
< 'No. There is hope yet, Caroline.'
< 
< 'If _he_ relents,' she said, amazed, 'there is! Nothing is past hope, if
< such a miracle has happened.'
< 
< 'He is past relenting,' said her husband. 'He is dead.'
< 
< She was a mild and patient creature, if her face spoke truth; but she
< was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so with clasped hands.
< She prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was
< the emotion of her heart.
< 
< 'What the half-drunken woman, whom I told you of last night, said to me
< when I tried to see him and obtain a week's delay--and what I thought
< was a mere excuse to avoid me--turns out to have been quite true. He was
< not only very ill, but dying, then.'
< 
< 'To whom will our debt be transferred?'
< 
< 'I don't know. But, before that time, we shall be ready with the money;
< and even though we were not, it would be bad fortune indeed to find so
< merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light
< hearts, Caroline!'
< 
< Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children's
< faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little
< understood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man's
< death! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the
< event, was one of pleasure.
< 
< 'Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,' said Scrooge; 'or
< that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever
< present to me.'
< 
< The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet;
< and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself,
< but nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit's house;
< the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the
< children seated round the fire.
< 
< Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues
< in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him.
< The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they
< were very quiet!
< 
< '"And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them."'
< 
< Where had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy
< must have read them out as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why
< did he not go on?

< 'If you please,' said Scrooge. 'Not a farthing less. A great many

< 
< 'It's only once a year, sir,' pleaded Bob, appearing from the tank. 'It
< shall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir.'
< 
< 'Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,' said Scrooge. 'I am not going to
< stand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore,' he continued,
< leaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that
< he staggered back into the tank again--'and therefore I am about to
< raise your salary!'
< 
< Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary
< idea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the
< people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.
< 
< 'A merry Christmas, Bob!' said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could
< not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. 'A merrier Christmas,
< Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year! I'll raise
< your salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will
< discuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of

< Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
< 
< Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
< electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
< including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
< because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
< people in all walks of life.
< 
< Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
< assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
< goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
< remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
< Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
< and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
< To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
< and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

< Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
< Literary Archive Foundation
< 
< Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
< spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
< increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
< freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
< array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
< ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
< status with the IRS.
< 
< The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
< charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
< States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
< considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
< with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
< where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
< SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
< particular state visit http://pglaf.org
< 
< While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
< have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
< against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
< approach us with offers to donate.
< 
< International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
< any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
< outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
< 
< Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
< methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
< ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
< To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

< 
< Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
< works.
< 
< Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
< concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
< with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
< Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
< 
< 
< Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
< editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
< unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
< keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
< 
< 
< Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
< 
<      http://www.gutenberg.org
< 
< This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
< including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
< Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
< subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
