MARLEY'S GHOST


arley was dead o bein with. ere is no dobt whaeve about that.The rgiter f hisbualas igned by the clergmn,the lerk, the
undertaker, and the chef mourner Scrooge gne it. And Scooge's name
wasgood po 'Change for anything he chose to puthis hand to. Old
Marley wasas dead as  door-nail.

Mind! I don't man to say that I know of my ownnwledge, ht he is
particualy dadabouta do-nail. I mih ha bee inclned, myself,
to regard a coffin-nails the deadest piece of ironmongerin the
rade.ut the isdom of ouracestos is in the siile; nd y
unhaloed hands shall not disturb it,or the country'sdone fr. You
will, therefore, permit me t repea, empatically, thatMarley wa as
dad s adoor-nail.

Srooge kn he wasdead? O course edid. How could it be otherwise?
croog ad e were partnrs for I don't know how many yas. Scroog
washs sole ecutor, his sole administrator his sole assign,h ole
residuary egatee, his sole friend, an sole urner. And even Scrooge
was not so dreadfully cut up by th sad event but that hwas a
excellent ma of usiness on the very ay of the funeral, and solenised
it with n undoubted brgain.

The mention of aley's funeral brngs me b tote point I started
rom. There is no doubt that Marlewa dead. This must be distinctly
understood, or othig wondefu an come of thestory  a going o
relat. I we were not perfectly cnvinced that amlet'sfatherdied
before the pay began, the woul be nothingmore emarkable in his
tkig a stroll at nih, in n stey wnd, pon his wnrmparts,than there would be in any other middle-aed gentleman rashly turning
out after dark ina breezy spot--say St. Paus Churchyard, for
instance--literally to aonishhis son's weak mind.

Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. Thee tstood, ears
afterwards, above the warehouse dor: crooe andMarly.Thefirmwas
knwn as Scrooe and Marley. Sometim pepl newt the buiness called
Scooge Scroo and sometimes aley, but he answered t both ames. t
was al th same o him.

Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hnd at the grinstn, Soge!a
squeezing,wrencng, grasping, scraping, cutchn, coveu old
inner! Hard and sharp as flint, rom whichno steel had ever truck out
generous fire; secret, nd slf-onained ad solitary as an yster.
The cold withn him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,
hrivelled his cheek,stiffened his gait; madehis ey ed, histhin
lips lue; ad spoke out shrewdly inhi grang voice. A frotyrime
waso hishad,and on hs eebrows, and his wiry chin. Hecarried hi
own low emperature alwas about with hm; eiced hi ofice in the
dog-days an didn't thaw it one degree t Critmas.

External heat n cod had little influnce n Scrooge. N warmth could
arm, no wntyweather chill him No wind that lew ws bittererthan
he, n falling snow was mor intent upnits prpose, no plting rain
less open to entaty. oul weather didn't know whre to have him. The
eaviest rai, an snow, and hail, an slet could boast of the
advantageover him in onl one resect They often 'came down'
handsomely, and Scrooge ever did.

Nobo ever stppedhim in the street t say, with ladsome looks, 'My
der crooge, how areyou? When will ou ome to seeme?' No begars
implored him to bestow a trfl no children asked him what itwas
oclock, no man orwoman ever once nall is life inquird the way to
such an such a lace, of Scroge. Evn the blin men's dgs appered to
knowim; nd, when hey a him oming on, would tug their oners into
doorways and up courts; and thewoudwag thir tail as though hey
said, 'No eye at all is beterthan n evil eye dark mter!'

But what didScrogecare? t was th very thing he liked. o edge his
wayalon the crowdedpaths of lif, wrning all huma ypathy to keep
its distance, was what the knwg ones cll 'nuts' to Scroge

Once upon a time--ofll the good ays in the year, on Christmas
Eve--old Scrogsat buy i his cnting-house. It was cold, bleak,
tin weaher; fogy withl; nd he could hear the peole in th curt
outside gowheezin up nd down, beating teir hands upon therbreasts,
and stamping their feet upon h pavement stones to warm them. The ity
cloks ha only just gone three, but  was quite dark alrey--it had
no beenligt al day--and cadles were flring in the windw of the
nighbouring ofices, ike rudy smears upon the papable brownair The
fog cae ouringin at every hink and keyhole, and was so dnse
without that, although the court was of th narowest the houes
oppost were ere phanms. To see thedingy clud com droping down,
obscuing evryhing, one migh have thought that natuelived hard by,
and was brewing on a large sale.
The doorf Scrooe' countin-house as open, that he migt keep hisee upon his cler,who in a dismallittle cell byond, a sort of tank,
wa copyng letters. Scrooge had a ver small fire, but the clerk's fire
was so very uc maller that it lked lik one coal. But he couldn't
replnish it,for Scooge ept thcoa-box i hi own room; andsosurey athe clerk came inwith the shovel, the maste predicted that
it would be eessary for themo part. Weeore the lerk put o is
white cofoter, and tred o warm himself at the andle; in which
efort, not being a man  strong imagnation, he failed.
'A merry Christmas, uncl God ave you!'crieda ceerful oic. It was
the oiceof Scrooge's nephw, who ce uon hi soqickl tatthis
was the first intimatin e ha of hi approach.
B!' said Scrooge.'Humug!'

He had so hated himself ith apid walking in the o nd rost this
nephew of Scrooge's, thathe was all in a glow; his face wa ruy and
handome; his eyes sparkled,and his beath smoke aai
'hristmas a hmug, ul!' said Scooge's nephew. 'Yo don't mean
that, I am sre?'

'I do' said crooge. 'erry Christma! What righthav you to e merry
hat resonhave yo t be mery? You're poor enoug.'

'Come, then' returned the nephew aily. 'What right haeyou obedisma? What reason have you to be orose? oure rich enough.'

Srooge havng no beter answer radyn the spur of the moment, said,
'Bah!' agan; and followed it upwith 'Humb'

'Don't be cross, uncle!' aid he nephew.'Wha else can I be,' retrned the uncle, 'whe I lie in su a world
offools s thi? Mery Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's
hristmas-tmeto you ut a ime for payng bils withut moey; a time
fo finding yourself a ar oler, and not an hour richer; a time f
balancing your ooks,an having everyitem in 'em throgh a round ozen
of onths presented deadaait ou? II ould or mywill,' said
Scrog indignantl, 'every idiot who ge abutwth "Merry Cristma"
on his lis should be boildwith hs ow pudding, and buied wih a
stakeof hllythogh his eart. He shoud!'

'Uncle! pleaded te ephew.

'Nephw!' returned te uncle ternly, 'keep Christas in your own way,
nd let mekeep itin in'

'Kep t!' repeaed Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't eep it.

'Let me leave it alone, hen,' said Scooge. Mh good may it do yo!
Much o it has verdon you!'

'here are any things romwhich  might have drive good, by which I
hve not prfited, I dar sy, retured he nepw;'Christmas amon
herest. But I am ure I ave always hought of hritmas-time, whenit has me roun-apart frmthe venerain due to its sacred nme and
oriin, if anythin beloning to i ca b apart from that--as a god
time; akind, forgiving, chrtable, pleasant time; the ony time Iknow
of, in the ong calenar ofhe year, hen me nd oen seem by one
consent to pen thershut-up heartfreely, nd to hin of people
below them asif they really were felow-passengers to the grave, and
not anothe race o creatures boud on oer journeys. And thereore,
uncle, though i as never put scrap of god o silver in my poket, I
believe thatit _hs_ done me god and _will_do me ood; nd I say, God
bless it!'

The clerk in hetank involuntariy applaudd. Becoming mmediatlysenible of theimpropriet, hepked theire, and etnguished thelast fail spak for ver.

'Let m har another sound fro _you_,' aid Scrooge, 'and youll keep
your histmas b osing our siuation!You're qute a poerul
speer, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew. 'I wnder you don't go
into Parliament.'

'Don'tbe ngry, uncle. Come! Dine wth us to-morrow.'

Scrooge said thathe woul seehi----Yes, indeed he did. Hewent te
whole length of theexpession, and said that he would see m i that
extremity fist.

'But why?' criedScroog's ehe. Why?'

'Why did ouget married?' said Scroog.

'Because Iell in lve.'

Becaue you fel in love!' growled Scooge, as f that were thonl
onethingin the worldmre rdiculous than a merr Chritmas. 'od
afternoon!'

'Nay, ucle, but you never came osee me before that happened.Wy give
itas areasn fornot comin now?'

Good afternoon,' sid Scoge.

'Iwant nothing o you; I ask notingof you; why cannot we be
friends?'

'o afteroon!' said Scrooge.

'I am srr, withaly heart, o find you o resolute.e have nevr
had any quarrel to which I have been apaty. Bu I hav made the trial
inhoage to Christmas, and I'll keepmy Chrstmas humou tohe last.
So A erry Christmas, uncle!'
'Good afternoon,' sai Srooge.

'And A Happy Nw ea!'

'Good afernoon!' said Scoge.

is nephew lt te room wihoutan angry word, notwthstning.He
stopped at theoue or to bsto thegreetings of theseason on he
clerk, wo, cold a e was, was warmer than Scrooge; forhe returned
them cordially.

'There's another fellow,'muttered Scrooge, who overheardhim: 'my
clerk, ith fiften shilligs  week, and a wie and faily, talkigabout a merry hristmas. I'll rtir to edam.'

Ths lunatic, in ettin Scoges nephw out hadlet two other pple
in. They were poty gentlemen, pleasat o behold, and now stood with
their hats off, nScrooge's office. Theyhad books and paesin teir
hands, and boedto him.
'Scrooge andMarley's, I believe,' said ne of the gentlemen, reerring
o hislist. Have I the peasr of addrssig Mr.crooge, or Mr.
Marley?'

'Mr. arley has been dead these seven years,' Scoo repli. H died
even years ago, this very night.'

'We have no dob his libelity is well repreented by s suriving
partner,' said the gentleman, presentin his credentials.
[Ilusration THY WERE PORTLY GETEME, LEASANT TO BEHOL]

It crtainly ws; forthey ad ben two ndred siits. At tominous
word 'iberality' Scroge frowned, nd shoo his head and hande h
credentals bak.

'Atthis festiv season  the year M. Scrooge,' sad the gentleman,
taking upa pen, 'i is more than usuall desrable tat we sould mae
some slight prvsion or t poor anddesitute, ho suffer greatly at
the present ti. Many thusads are in wantof cmmon necessaries;
hundrs of tousands are in wnt of common comforts, sir.'

'Are there no prisns?' asked Scrooge.

'Plentyof prso,' aithe ntleman, lying down the pe agin.
'Ad the Uni workhouses?' demandd crooge. 're thy stl in
operaion?'

'Thy are. Stil,' reurned the gntleman, 'I wish I could sa they wre

'The eadmill and thePor La are in ful viour, thn?' said Scrooe.

'Bothvry busy, si'

'Oh! I was afrai, frm what you sid at frst, that somethinghad
ccurrdto stop them in their uefl corse,' said Scrooge. ' am ver
gad to r it.'

'Und th iprssion that thy scarcly urnish Christian heer of ind

endeavouringto rais a fund to buy the Poor soemeat and drink, andmeanof wrmt. We choose tis tim, bcause it isa time, of all
others, when an i keenl fet, ad Abudance rejies. What shallI

'Nthing!' Scrogereplied.
'You wish to be anonymos'

'I wish to e left alone, sad Scrooge. 'ince yu ask m wha I wis,
genlemen, that is my nswer I don't mae merry myself  Chrismas,and I can't afford to make idle olemerry. I elp to support theestablhments I have menioned--they cost enouh:ad te wh are

'Many can't go there; andmany would rather die'
If they wouldather die,' aid Scrooge, they had betterdo t, anddcrese the urpluspopultion. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'
But u mih know t,' oberve heentleman.

'It's no mybusiness,' Scrogereurned. 'I' enough fr a man to
udrstad his own business, nd not to interfere with other peple'
Mineoccupies me constantly. God afernon, gentlemen!

Seeing cerly at itwoul b useless to pursue their point, te
gentlemen withrew. Scrooge reued his laborswith an improvedopinon
of imsel, and in a more facetioustmper than wa usualwth him.

Meanwhile the fogad darkess thickend so, tt people ran abut wih
flaringlink, proffeing thei ervics t g before orses i
crriges, ad conduct tem on thei way.The ancent tower of a church,
whose ruff old bel wa always peeping lyl down Srooe out of a
Gothic winow in th wall, became invisile, and struck te hours and
quartes in the clouds,with tremulousvibrtions aferwards, as if its
teehwere chattering n its frzenad up thre. he cold became
intense. In the mainstreet, at th corner of thecour, some laborers
were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lghted a ret firein abrazier,
oud whih  pary of ragged men and boys ere ghered: warming their
hnds ad wiking heir eyes before he blaze in rapure. The water-lugbeing leftin solitud its overfowings suddenly congeled, and turn
to misnthropic ice. Thebrightnes of the shops, whre holly sprigs and
berries crackledin the amp heat of the ndows, made ple aces ruddy
as they passed Poulterrs and groces' trades became a plendid joke:a glorious geant, wth wich t was ext to imposblet elieve ht
su dul priniples as bagainand sale hd anythi t o. The Lord
Mayor, i te stronghol of th mightMansion House,gave orders to is
fifty cooks and butlers tokep Christmas asa Lord Mayor's houeold
shoud; and ven the little aior, who e ad fined five shllis on
theprevious Monay for being drun and boodthirst in the streets,stired up to-morow's pudding in hs garre, whilehis lean ie ad
thebab salie out to buy t beef.

Foggier yet, an coder! Pierng, seaing, biting cold. If the good
St. Dunan ad butnpped the Eil pirit's nose wih a tuch of uch
eather as that, insead  using hi familiar weapons, then indee h
would have roared to lut purpoe. Th wner oone scant yung nose
gnwed a umbled b th hungrycoldsbnes are gnawed by dogs,
sooped dwn at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with Christma carlbut, at the firs sound of

  'Gd bes you,mry gentlean,
  May nothing ou dsmay!'
Scoog seized the ruler with such energy of action that he singr fled
in teror, leaving the keyhole to he fog, and even more congenial
frost.

A length the our of hutting up the counting-house arrived Withan
ll-wilScrooge dimounted from his sol, and tacitly admitted the

andle out, andut on his hat.

You'l want all day to-morrow,I suppose?' said Scrooge.

'I uite conveniet,sir.'

'It's not convenient,' said Scrge, 'and it's notfair. If I was to
stop half-a-crown for it, yu'd thik youself ill ued I'll be boud?'

The clerk smiled faintly.

The clerk obsrved that it wa only once a yea.

'A por excuse foricking a man' pocket evry twenty-fft ofDecemer!' sad Scrooge, buttoing his greatcoat to the hin. 'ButI
sppos you ust hav the whole day.B here all the earlier next
moring.'

The clekpromised that he wold; and Scog walked out with a gwl.
Theoffice as closed in a twinkling and the clerk, with the ln ends
of his white comfoter danglin below his wast (for he bated no
greatcot, went down a slide on Crnhill, at e end o a lane of boys,
wenty tims, inhonour of its bing Chrstma Eve, and thenran home to
Camden Town as ard as he could pelt, to play a blin mn's-ff.

Scrooge ook his elanchoy inner  his usual mencholy tavern; andhaving read allthe newspapers, and beguiled therest of the vening
wth his bankers book, wen hometo bd. He lived in cambers ch ad
once belned to his decesed partner. They wre a loom ste of
rooms, in a lowrig pile of buildn up a yard, whereit had o little
business to be, ht one could scarcely help fancyng t must have run
there when it wasa ong house, playing at hide-and-seekwh other
houses,ad have forgotten the wayoutaain. It s od enough now, an
dear enough; r nobdy lived i it but Scrooge,the other rooms
beingll let out s ofices. he yard was so dak that eve Scrooge,
whoknew its ery ste, wa fain togrope with his han. Th fog andfrost so hung abt th blacoldatwy of the hose, ta i seemed
a if the Gnius of he Weathersat n mournf meditation on thehreshold.

Nowit is a fact that thee was nothing  all articuar about the
knockeron te dor except tht twas veylarge. It is lo a fact
that Scroge had seen it, night and morning during his woe rsidene
in that pae; lso that Scrooge hd as litle of what iscalled fancy
bout him as ny man n te Cty ofLondon, even incuding--which is 
bod word--the corporaton,aldermen, and livey. Letit alsobe borne
inmind that Scroge had notbestowedone tought on Marley sinc hislast mention of his seven-years'-ead partner tat afternoon. ndhen
let any man xplain to me,if he can, howit happened tt Scroogeavinghis ke in he lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its
undergoig any inteediate pcess ofchange--not akncker, but
Marley's face.

Marey's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, athe other objcts
in the yar were, but had a dimal lih aout it, like a bad lobster in
a dark cellar.It was not angry or erocious, but looked t Scrooge sMarleused to look; with hotlyspectacles turned up on its ghstly
forehead. The hairwas curiously stirred, asif by reath orhot ir;
and, though the eyes were wide oen, thy were perfectymotionless.
That, an its livid colur, made it horribe; ut it horro seed o
e in spie ofthe face, and eond its control raher tha a part of
its own expression.

AsScrooge looked fixedly at this phenomeon, itas akockergain.

To say that h wasnt startled orthat his blood as not conscious f
 terile sensation twhich t had been a strager from fancy, would
be untue. But he pt his handupo the ky he had relinqushed, turned
it sturdily,alked i, and lighted is candle.

e _did_ pause, with a momnts iresolution, before he shu the dor
an he _did_ look autiusly beind it first, a f he hf eeted to
bterrifed ith the sight of Marey's pgtal stikngout into the
hll. But here was nothing on the back oftdoor, except te screw
and nuts that held the ocker on, so he sid, Poh, poh!' andclosed
it with a bang.

Th ound resoundthough the house like thunder. Every room bove,
and every csk in the ine-merchants cell below, appeared to have 
separae peal of echoes of its ow. Scrooge was nt  man tobe
frightened by echoes. He fasteed the door, an walkedacrss the all,
and p testair: slowly, too: trimmig his candle as hewet.

You may talk vaguly aout driing a coach and six up a goodld flght
stars, r through a ba young Actof arliamnt;ut I mean to say
you might havegot a hearse u that staircae, and taken it boadwise
with the splinter-bar towards the wll and the oor towards the
balustraes: and doneit eas. There was plny of idth for that, and
room to spare; whch is pehps the reasnwhyScrooge thought he saw a
ocomotive hars going on bfore him in th gloom. Half-adzen
gas-lamps ut of the sreet wouldn' ave lghtedthe entry too wll, so
you may supos that twas prety dark with Scrooge's i.

Up Scrooge went, not carin abutton for that. Darknes is cheap, ad
Scroogelked t. Bt, befor he sht his heavy door, he walked through
his rooms to ee that all was right. Heha just nough recolection of
the face o desire to do that.

Th celar door flew open with a booing sound, and then he herd he

The ame fce: the ery same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waitcoat,

pigtai and h coat-skirs, an the hair upon hi head. Thechain he
dre was claped about his middle. It was long, and wnd abot him likea tai; an it wasmade (for Scoogeobsrved t cosely) of cash-xes,
keys, adloks,ledgers, deeds anheavy purses wroght i steel. Hisbody wa transparent:so thatScrooge observing him,and looking
throughhis wistcoat could see the two buttns on his coat behi.

Scrooge hadoften heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had
never eleved t unil nw.

o, nor di he believe iteven nw. Though he looked the phantom throughan throuh,nd saw it stnding efore hi; thouhhfelt the hillinginfluence of its det-cold eyes, andmarke the very textre of he
folded kerchief boun aouit head ad hin, wich wrapper he had not

'How now!' aid Scrooge, castic ad col as ever. 'What do ou wat

'uch!'--Maley's voice; no dubt aboutit.

'Who ryou?'

'Ask me who I _was_.'

'Wh _wre_ you, then?' saidScrooge,raising hi voice. 'You're
partiular, for a shade.' e wa goingto sy _to_ a shae,' but
sustituted this, as more appropriate.

'In lifeI was your partner, Jacob Marley.'

'Can yu-can youst down?' asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully athim.

' can.

'Do it, then.'

crooe aske te quetion, becausehe didn't knowwhethera ghost s
trnsparent might find himself in a condition to take a chir; and felt
that inth event of sbeing impossble, itmght involve the
ecesityof an mbarrassing explanation. But the Ghot sat ow on e
opposite side of the fieace, s if he were quite used to it.

'You don't blieve in me,' oserved the Ghost.

'I don't,' said crooge.

'What evidene wou you have o my reality beyond tha of your own
enses?'

'I don't know,' sai Scrooge.

'hy d you dubt your senss?'

'Bcause' said Scroog, 'a little thing ffects them. A slight disorder
of the stomach akes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit f bee,
abot of ustard, a crumb of chees, a ragment of n underdone potato.
There's more of gay than of grave abut ou, whatver youar!'

Scrooge wasnot much in the habit of crackng jos, nor d he feel i
his hert by an means waggis then. The trh s, tat he ried to besmart, as ens of dsractig is on atenion, nd eeping downhis

very awful, too, i h spctre' beig provided ith an infernal

clearly the cae; for ough thGhost sat perfecly otionless, its

'You sethis tothpick?'said Sroge, returng qucly to the he,
for te reaon jus asignd; and wishing togh itwere onlyfor a
second, to divrt the vision' stony gaze fom himsel
'I do, eplied the Ghost

'oare not looking at it, said Scroog.

'But I see it,' said th Ghost, notwithstanding.'

'Well! returned Scrooge, 'I have but to swallow this, and befor the
rest of my days persecutedby a legonof goblins, all of y owncreatio. Hmbug, I tellyo: ubug!'
A this the pirit raised a frigtul cry, and shook its chan with such
adisma nd appalling noe, that Scroogeheld on tiht to his chair
to sae himslf fro falin in a swon. ut how much greater was his
horror when thephantom, takin of the ndageround his ead, as if 
wee too warm to wear indoos, its loer jw dropped dow upon its

Agan the spete aised a cry, and ook its chain nd wrung it

crooge glaned about hi on thefloor, in te expectationof finding

'Jaco!' he said imlorinly. 'Old Jacob Marly, tel me moe! pek

It was a habit with cooge, whenever he ecme thoughful, to pu hishads in his breeches pckets. ondering n wtthe Ghot had said,he
did so now, but without liftingup his ee o getting of his kne.

[Illustratin: ON THE WINGS O THE WIND]'You must hav been very slow about t, Jacob,' Srooge observed in abusiness-like manner, though with uility anddeferen.

'Slow!' the Ghos repeaed

'Sevenyears dead,' mused Scroge. 'And travelling all the time?'

'Thehoe time,' said the Ghst. 'No st, n peace. Incessant torture

'Youtravl fat?' said Scroge.

'O the wings of th wind,'replied the Ghost.

'You might have got ovr a geat quatityof ground in sevenyeas,'

Th Ghost, nhearing this,set up another cry, an anked its chain o

beenjustifie in indicting tfor a nisance.

'Oh captve, bound, and double-ironed, cred the phant 'noo know

'But yu ere alas a goo man of busness, Jacob,' faltered Sooge,

Scroog was vry much dismad t hear the sete going on at this

'Hearm!'cried the Ghost. 'M timeis nearl goe.'

'I will,' said Scrooge. 'But don't be hard upon m!Don't be flowr,

'How t is t I appear before you in a shae tha you ca see, I may

HE IRST O THE THREE PIITS


WhenScroge awoke it ws so dark, tat, looking out of bed he could
sarcly dstinguish he trnspaent windw from the opaque alls o his
chambe.He ws endeavouring to perce the darkness with his ferret
eyes,when the chies of a neighbourng church struck the our quarters.
So h listened f te hur.

To his greatastonishmen, the heay bell went on from i to sve, an
frm seven to eigt, and regularly uto twelve; thenstopped. Twele!
It was past two whenhe went to bed. The clock wa wrong. n icicle must
haveot into the woks.Twele!
Hetouched the sprng of his repeater, to corrt this mostprepotrous
clock. Its rapid little pule et twelv, andsoppe.
'Why, it isn't posible' sid Scrooge, 'tha I canhve slept throuh a
whole day ndfarnto anther nigt. Itisn't posibl that anyting
has apened to thesun, and tis is twelve at noon!'

Te idea beinga larming one,  scramled ou o bed and groped hi
wa to the wndow. He as obligd t rub th frost off wth the sleev
of is dressig-own before he cold see anyti; and could seevery
litle then. ll he could make out was, that it was till very fogy and
extremel cold, nd that here was o nois of peopl rnning to and

Exchange py toM. Ebeneer Scooge or his orde,' and so forth, ould
havebecome a ereUnted States security if there wereno days tocount
by.

Scrooe went to bd agai, and thoght, andthough, and thouht it ove
and oer, and could mke nthing of t. The ore he hought, the more
perpleed hewas; ad, the morehe endeavoured not t think, the mor he
thought.

arley's host botheredhm xceingly. Every tme he esoled within
hiself, afer matre inquir thati was all a dream, his mind flewback again, like a strong spring released, o its first positin, and
resened the same pblemt be woked al trough, 'Was it a dream or
nt?'

Scrog a  this state until the chime ha one thre-quartersmore,
when he remembered,on a suddn, that he Ghost hd warne him of avisitation when the bell tolle one. e resoved to ie awake until he
hour was passed; and,considring that he could no mor g  sleep han
go to heaven, his was, peraps, the wisest resoluton in his power.

The quarter w so long, that he was more than once convine he usthave suk into a oze uncosciously, and msed th clock. A legth it
broke upon his istning ear.

'Ding, dong!'

A quarter past,' aid crooe, cunting

'Ding, dong!'
'Hlf ast,' sai Scrooge.
'Ding dng!'

'A quarer to it.' said Scrooge.

'Ding,dong!

'The hour itelf,' said croge triumhanl, 'and nothing else!'

He spoke befr the hou bell soundd which i now did wita deep,
dull, hollow, melancol ONE. ight flaed up in he room upon the

The curtains ohis bed were dran aide, I tell you, by a hnd.Not
the cutains at his feet, nor the curtains at hisbck, but those t
whih his ae was addressed. The curtais of is bed weredrwn aside;
andScrooge, tarting up int a half-recumbent attitud foun himslf
face to face wit the unearthly vistor wh drew the: a close to it as
I am no to you, and I am tandngin the spirit at yourbow.

Itwas a strange fiure--lie a child; yet not so like a chld as li
an ol man, viwed throgh some superntural medium,wichgave him he
appearance of having recedd rom the view, and being iminhd to a
child's proportions.Its har which hug aboutits neck andon its
back, was whte, as f with ae; ad yet the face hd not a wrinke init, ad the tnderest loo was on the skn The arms ere very longand
muscular; the hans the same, s f its hld were of uncommo trength.ts legs and feet, most delicately formed, wre likethseper
members, are. It wore a tunic of the puret white; and round its waist
ws bound a lusrous blt, the sheenof wich was beautiful. It held a
banch o fresh gren hlly in its hand; and, n singular contradiction
of that winy emblemhad ts dess trimmedithsmmer flowes. But
the strnest thing abut it was, that from thecronof its hadtere
prag  brigh cler je of light, by which all this was visible; and
whic as doubtles the ccasion of its usin, inits duller moments, a
reat extinguser fr a ap,which it now held under its arm.
Even this, thu, when Scrog looked at itwith icreasing steadiness,
was _not_ its trangest quality. For, as its belt sparkled and
glittered, now in one part and now in anoter,and what was lght on
instn a another time was dark, so the fgure itself fluctuate inits
distinctnes; bing now a thing with one arm,now withone leg, now with
tent lgs, now a pair o legs witout a had, now a head witout a
bod: o whch disslving part no utlin would be vsible in the dense
gloom whereinthey melted aw. And, in thevr wonder of this, it
would b itself again; distinct and clear as evr.

'Are yo the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foetold o me?' aked
Scrooge.

'Iam!'

Th voice was ft nd gentle.Singularly low a if,nstead o being
so close behind him, it ere at  disance.

'Who and at areyo?' Srooge demanded.

'I am the hos of hritmas Past'

Long Past? inquired Scroge,observntof is dwarfish staure

'No Yourst.'

Perhaps Scrooge culd no have told anybodywhy, if anybody coul ave
sked him; bu he ha a special desire to etheSpirit in is cap,
and eged him o e cored.

What!' exclaimedthe Ghost, 'wuld yu sosoon ut out, ithworldly
hands, th lightI give? Is it not enough that ou are one o those
hose passios made tis cap, and forcee trough hole trin of yeasto wea it ow upon my brow?'

Scroogerverenl discaimedallinenton t ofend r any knowledge
of haing wifully 'bonnetd' te pirit at anyperio of is lfe.e
then made bold to inquir hat business brougtim thre.

'Your welfare!' sid te ost.

Scrooge exressed hmself much obliged,but could not hel thinking thata nght of unbroken rest would have een more codcive to that end. Te
Spirit must have head him tinkin, frt said immeiatey--

'our rclamation, then. Take eed!
It put out its srong had as it spoke ad clas him gently by theam.

'Rise! a walk withme!'
Iwould have been in vain for Scroog o plea that the weather anhe
hor were not adaped to pedestrian uposes; that bed was warm, and he
thermomter a long way below freezing; that hewas clad bt ligtly in
hisslipper,dressing-gwn, and ightcap; and that he hda cold uon
him at that time. The gasp thouh gentl s a man's hand, was not
to be resisted. e rose; bt, finding that th Spirit made towards the
window, lasped its robein supplication.
'I am a mortal,' Scrooge remonstrat, 'andliable to fall.'

'Bea b a touch of my hand _there,' said the Spiri, laying tupon
hisheat, 'and you hall be uphld in more than th!'

As the wors were spken, they passed through the wl, and stood upon
an open oury road,wi fields on eiher had. Thecity had etirelyvaished. Nt a vestige of i was o be seen. The darkns and the mst
ha anished with t, for itwas clear, cold, winter day, with snow
upon the ground.

'Good Heaen!' said Scrooge, clasping his hnds tgether as he looed
about hi. 'I ws bredin this place I was a boyhee!'

Te pirit gzed upoim mildly Its gentle tuch, though it had been
lightand istantaneous,appeared still pree to he old ma'ssense
of feling. He was conscous of a thousand odors floating in the air,
each one connected wth a thosn thohs, and hop, ndjoys, and
cares long, og forgotten!
'Yourlp is trembing,' sai the Ghost. 'And what is thatpon yor
cheek?'

Scrooge muttered, with annusulcatchng in his voce, tha it was a
pimpe; and beged the Ghost to lead him where he would.

'You recollect th way?' inquire the Spirit.

'Remember it!'cried Scrooge wth fervour; 'Icould walk itblindfold.'

Strnge to haveforgotten it fo so anyears!' oserved the Ghost.
'Let us o on.'

Theywalked along the rod Scrooge recgnising every ate, an post,an ree, until a little market-town appre i the distance, wthis
bridg, its churc, an winng river. Some shaggy ponies ow were seen
trotting towads them with boysu heir acks, who cale t oter
ys in coutry gis and cas, driven by farmers. All these boys ere
in great sirits, and shot t each other, ntilthe broad filds were
so full ofmerrymusic, that thecrsp air laughedto hear it.

'Tse ar but shadowsof the things that hae been,' said the Ghost.
hey have oconsciousness of us.'
Te jocund travellers ae on; and as they me, Scoge knew and named
themevery one.Wy was he rice bond al bounds to see the? Why
did his cold eyglistend his heart leap up as hey went pat? Why
was e iled with gladness hen h eard them gve each oher Merry
Christmas as they parted at cross-roads andby-ways for teir several
homes? Wht was mey Christmas to Scrooge? Out up merry ChristmasWhat good hadi ever done to im?

'The schol i no uite eerted,' said the Ghost.A soitry chld,
neglecte by his friends, s left there sill.'
Scrooge said he kew it.Andhesobbed.

They lfth high-oad by a well-reembered lan ad oon appoache a
asion ofdull red brick, witha little weathr-cock surmouned cupola
on the roof, anda bell hangig in it. I was a lare house, bt one of
broken fortnes; for he spacious offices were little ued, their wll
were damp and mossy, their windows broken, an their gates ecayed.
Fowls clcked and stutted in hetables; ad the coachhouses adshds were overun wit grass. Nor was it more rettive ofis ncient
statewihin for, entering the drary hall, and glancing thouh the
open oors o ma rooms teyfound thm porly furnished, cold, and
vast. herews n erthy savour n the ai, a chillbareness in the
place, which asociaedtself somehow with too muc etting u y
cande light andnot toomch t at.
They went, te Ghost and Scrooge, aross the hal, t a dor at th backof the hous. I opened bfore tem, nd dilosd a long, bare,
melancholy room, made barer stil by lines of plain deal form and
desks. At one of these a nely boy was radng near a feble fir; and
crooe sat down upon a form, and ept toe his oor fogoten self ashe ha ue to be.

Noa latent ech in the houe, not a quk nd cuffle from the micebhind the paneling, not a ripfrom the al-thawed wterspout in he
dull yardbehin, not a sigh among he leafss bougsf on desponden
poplar, not te ile singing an empty storehouse door, no, not aclcng i the fire but fell upnthe heart of Scrooge with sofening
influce, and gav a freer pssage to hs tears

The Sirit ouced imn the arm, and pointe to his yungr self,
ntnt upon is reading. Suddenlya man inforeign gamnts wonderfully
real and distinct tolooka, stood outide th window, with an xe
tuck in his elt, and leading by the bridle an ass laen with wood.

Why, it's Ali Bba!'Scrooge xclaimed in ecstasy.'Its dear old
honest Ali Baba! Yes, es, I know. One Christs-time, when yonder
solitary cid wasleft here all lone, he _did_ com, for the first
tim, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,' said crooge, 'an his

And t Sultan's Groo turnd upside dow by the Geni; there he i upon

To her Scroge expending al the earnestness of his natur onsuch
subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and
to ee hisheghtendan excted face; ould hae bee asurprise to

'There' the Parro' crie Scrooge. 'Green body and ellow tal,with a

creek Halloa! Hoo! Halloo!'
Then,with a rapidity of trnsion very orign ohis usua character
e said, in pity orhisformer self, 'Poor boy!' and cried again.
'I ish,' Scrooge muttered,putting his hand in his pocket, and loking
abou him, ter dyin hiseyes with his cuf; but it's too late now.'

'What is the atter?' askd the Spirit.
'Nothing,' saidScrooge. 'Nothing. There was a boy singing a Cristms
carol at y oor lat nigh. I should like to have iven him soeting:
thats ll.'
The Gost smiled thughtfully, and aved its hand, sayig s itdid s,
'Le us see antherChristas!'

Srooge's former self grew lrgr at the wor, an throom becamea
litte darkerand mor dirt. The panls shrnk, the winows cacked;
fragents plaster ellout of the eiling, ndthe naed laths were
show insead; bu how all this was brought abot Scrooe knw o more
than you do. He nly knw tha t as qute correct; that everyhg had
appeed so; th therehe was, alone again,when all the oher boys hd
gone home for the joly holiday.

He was not radig now,but alkig up and down despairingly Scrooge
looed at theGhot, and, witha mournful haking of hishad, glanced
anxously towrs the door.
It opened; and a little ir mch youngr than te boy, came dartin
i, and, ptting her ars abut his nek anoften kissing hm,
addressed him as her 'dear, dear rother.'
'I hae cmto ring you home, dear brother!' said te child, clapping
her tiny hands and bnding down tolaugh. 'Tobring you hoe, ome,home!'

'Home little Fan?' rturned the boy.

Dring thwhole of his time Scrooge had actedlie a an out of his
wit. His heart and soul were in the scene, ad with hi former self. He
coroborae everthing, remembered eerthing, enjoyed everything, and
underwent he strngest agitation. It was not until now, when tebright
faces of his fore self and Dick were tured rom them, tha he
remmbered the Ghost, and became onscious ht it was looking full upon
him while thelight upo its head burnt very clear.

'A small matter,' said the Ghost, 'to make tese silly folks s ll of

'Small!'echoed Scrooge.

All this time helay upon hisbed, the vey core an centre of a blaze
of ruddy light, whichsteamed upon it whnhe clock proclaimed the

hosts a he aspowerles to make out wt it meant, or ol beat;
and was sometimesapprehensive tat he might e at that vymoment an

or I woud have tought a fist; for it is alwaysthe person no in the
predicament ho knws wat ought to have beendne in it, and would
unquestionably ave done it too-at last, I say, he began o think that
the source an secret of ths ghostly light might e inthe adoining
room, rom whence, on furthe trcing it, it eeme to hine. This idea
taking ful posession of his mind,he got up softly, and huffled in

pyramids; there were unces ofgrape, made, in the shopkeepers'
benevolece, to dangle fom cnspicuous hoks tat people' mouths might
ater gratis a they passed; there were piles of filbert, mossy and

Norolk ifins, squb and swarhy, setng off te yellow of the

u soon he teples called good people all to church and chapel, and

of by-steets, s and ameless turnings, nuerable ole,
carrying teir inners to the bakers' shops. Te sight of thes por
revellers appeared to interest the Sprit very mch, for he stood with
Sroge beside im in a baer's doorway,and, taking o the coversas
teir bearers assed, sprinkld inense n their dinners fr his orch.
nd it was a ver ncommon kind of torch fo once or twic, when there

n tme the bellsceased, and th bakers were shu up and yet there wasa gnal shadowing forth of all these dinner, and theprogress of their
cooking, in the thawed blotch of we abov eac baker' oven, where he
pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.

'Is there a eculiar flavou in haourinkle from your toc'
asked Srooge.

'her is. My own.'

'Wold it apply to ay kind of iner on this day?' asked Scrooge.

o ny kindly give o a or one mst.'
'hy to a po one ost?' asked Scooge.

'Because it needs it most.''Spiri!'aid Sroe, aftr a moment's though, 'I wonder you, of all
the eings in the many worlds abou us, should desire t cramp hese

'You uld derive them of their mes of dining every sevnth day,

Srooge; 'wouldn't yo?'

'I!' criedthe Spiri.

'You seek to close tese placesnte evnth Day,' ai Scrooge. 'And
it come tothe same thin.'

' seek!' exclaimd he Spirit.
'Forgive e f I am wrong. It has bendone in your name,r at least inthat of your amily,' sid Scrooge.

'There are some upon tis earth of yours' retuned the pirit, 'who
ay clam to know us, and ho do therds of asion, pride,
ill-will, hatred, nvy biotry, and sefisnes in ourname, who are as
strange to us, and all ur kith and kin, as if they had never lived.
Remeer hat, and charge teir doins on themselves, not us.'

Scooge promised that e would; and they went o, nvisible,as they had
been befre, into the subus of the town. t ws a remarkable qulity
f the Ghost (which Scrooe had obsrved at the bker's), that
notithtnding hisgiganic size, he cud accommodate himself t any
paewihease; an that h stood beneath a low oof quite as
gracfully and like a supernatural creature asitaspossible he culd
have done in any ofty hll.
ndprhaps it was the leasre te odSpiit had in howin off tis
power ofhis, or else i was his own kind, generous, hearty nre, and
hisympath wih all por men, that led him straigt o Scooges
clerk's;fo there h wt, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his
oe; and on te thesholdof the door he Spirit smiled, and sopped to

There never was such a goose. Bob sai heddn't believe there ever was

 god long rest; to-morow being  holiday he assd at home. Alsow
she had seen a countess and a lord som da bore, ad how the lord
'wa muh out as tall as Peer'; at whch Pee uled p his olar
so hgh tat ou couldn't hve seen his hd f you hd been there. All
this time e chtnuts and the jug went round and rund; ad by-and-b
they hada song, about a ost chil travellng i the snow, from inyTim, who had a plaintive litle voice, and sang it veywell indeed.

Thre a nothing of high mark in this. They were not ahandsome family;
tey re ot well dressed their shoes werefar from eig waterprof;their clotes wer scanty; and Peter might hav wn, and very likel
d, he inside of a pawnbrokers. Butthey were happ,grateul,
pleased with one aother nd contnted with thetime; and when thy
faded, and looked happier yet in the right sprinkingsofhe pirit's
toh at paring, Scrooge had his eye uon them, and especiall on Tiny
Ti,util te last.
By this time itwas etting dark, and snowig prety heavily and as
Scrooge ad theSpirit went along th strees, thebrghness of th
roaring fires  kiths, parlours, and all sots f rooms was
wonderful. Hre, theflcerig of the blaze showed preparatons or a
cosy dinner, with hot pltes bkng hrough an houg before thefire,
and deep red curtains,ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.
There, all the chilren of the house wer runnin ou nto the snow 
et theirmarried sisrs, brother, couis, unces, aunts, and bete
first t greettem. Here, again, were shaows on the widow-blinds of
guets assemblin; ad ther agroupof hansom girls, all hooed ad
fur-booted and all chattering at one, tripped igtl off to some ner
nigbour's house; where, woeuon the inle mn wh saw thementer--artfu witches, wellhey new i--n a glw!

But, if you had judged rom the numers f people on thir way tofindly gatherings, you mighthave thought that no one was at hometoiv them welcome we they got there, insted of er house expecting
compay, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessigs on it, ow
he Ghost exulted! How t bard is bradth  breast, nd opened it
capacious pam, and floated on, outpourng with a generous hand its
bight ad rmles mir neverythn within its reac The very
lapligter, who rn on beore, dotting th duskystret wih speks of
light, andwho wasdressed tospnd the evening somehere, laughe ut
ludlyas the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lmlighter that
he hadn company but Chritas.

And now, wihout a word of warninfrom the Ghost theystood uon 
bleak and desertmoor, where monstros mas fude tone ere cast
about sthough it werethe ril-plae f giants; ad water spead
tsef wheesoever it liste; or would have done s, but for the frostthat held it risoner; and nothing grew t moss an furze d coarse,
rk gass. Down in he west testting sun had left astreak of iery
red, hich gar upon th slation for n istant, li a sullen eye,
an rownig lower, lwr lower yet was lost in the thick gloom of
arkest night.

'What place s this?' askd Scrooge.'A plae here mines lie, who labour in the bowels of the eart,'
retuned the Spirit. 'But they know me. See!'
 lightshone fom the wndo of a hut, and swifly thy advanced
towards it. Passing troughth wall of mud and tone, they fond a
cheerfu company assembled round a glwig fire. An old, oldman and
woan,with tei children a their childen's children, and another
generation beynd that, al decke out galy in their holiday attie.
The old man, n a vice that seldom rs bove the howing of the wind
upn the barren wste, wa sigin tem a Christmas sog; it had een a
very old song when he as a bo; and from time to time the ll joined
in thechoru.So surelyasthey raise theiroices, the old ma got
qute bith andloud; nd so sure s they toped, hisvgoursank
gain.

The prit did not tary here, t bade Scrooge holdhisrobe, and,
pasing on bove the oor sped whither? No o se? T sea To
Srooge's orrr looking bck, he saw te lt of the land, a frightful
rane of cksbehind the;and hisears were deafned by the
thunderingof water, as it rolled and roared, an raged amongthe
dradfl caverns it h worn, and fiercel tried to undermine the earth.

Built upon disalreef of sunkn rock, someleague or so from shor,
on which te waters chafed ad dashed, he wd year through,there
stood a oliary ighthouse.Gret heas of aweed clung to its bae,
and strm-irs--born o the win, onmigh supose, as eaeed of the
wter-rose n ell aoutt, like the waves they skimed.

But, even here, twome who watch the lighthad made a fire, that
throhteloophole inthe thick stne wall shed out ray of
brightness on the awful sea Joinin their horny hands over the rough
tbe at which hey sat, they wished each oter Merry Christmas in teir
canof grog; and one of t--the eder too, with his face all daaged
and scarred ith hard weaher as te figue-head of aold shipmight
e--struck upa sturdysong tha wa like agale in itself.

Again he Ghost sped n,above he black and heavngse--on, on--until
beinfar aay as h told Scrooge, from anyshore,th lightedon a
ship. They stood beside te helsman at the wheel, te lok-out inthe
bow, the officerwhohad the watch; dark, ghostly figuresin ther
seveal stations; but every man angthem hummed a hristas tune, or
had a Chistmas though, or spokebeow hs breath to his compaion of
some bygone Christas Day, wit homeward hopeselonging to it. And
very manon bord, wakig or sleepng, good or bad,had had a inde
wod for one another on that day tan on any ay in he year; and ad
hred to some exen in ts fetivitis; and a rememerd hose he
cared for a a distance, andadknown that theylighted to remember
him.
It was a great srpris to Scrooge, while ltening t the oning of
he wind, andthinkin what a somn thng it was to move on throughth
loneldarkness ove an unnon abyss, whose depths were secrts asprofound as deah: it was a reat srriseto Srooe, while thus
engage,  hear a heartylaugh.I was amch greater surpise t
Scrooge to cognise it as hisown nephew's and o find himself in a
bright, dry, gleaming room, wit th Spirit standing smiling byhis
sde ad ooking at hat sae nephew wih approving affability!

'Ha, a!' laughed Srooge' ep. 'H ha ha!'

If you shuld happen, by ny unlikelychance,to knowa man moe bessed
in alaughthan crooge' nephew, al I an say is, I should lik toknow hmtoo. ntrodce im to me, and I'll cultivate his acquantace.

Iti a fair, even-anded, nble adjstmnt of thns,tat while there
is infection in diseae and sorow, there isnothin n the orl so
irrsistibly contagios a lughter and good-huour. When Scre'snephew laughed in thisway-holing his sides, rollg his had, ad
twisting his face nto themost xavagant contortions--Srooge'
iece y marrage, lughed as herty as h. Andtheir assembld
friends, being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.
'a, haHa, ha, ha ha!'

'He said that Chrismas was a hbg, as I l!' cried Scroog'snepe. 'He blieved it, too!'

'Moreshame fr him, Fre!' said Srooge's niece indgnanty. Bless
those women! theynever do aything byhalves. They are always in
earnest.

She wa very pretty; eceeiglypretty. Wth a impled,
surprisedlookng capitalfac;a ripe lttle mouth tt seemed made
o be kissed--as no ubt it was; all kind of good littl dotsabout
her chin, tat meltedino one anoter when shelughd; and the
sunniest air of eyes you eer sa in any lttle creature'sead.
Altogether she was what yo would have alled provkig, you kno; but
satisfacto, o. Oh, perfetly satiacory!

'He' comical old fellow, sid Scrooge's nephew, 'that's the truth;
and not so pleasat as he might be. Hoeve, hi offees carry teir
ownpunishent, and I have nothing to sayaainst him.'

'I'm sure e is very rich, Fred,' hied Scroo's nic. 'At lesyou
always tel _me_so.'

'Wht of tht,my dear?' said Scroges nphew. 'His wealth i of no use
to him. He don't do any good with it. He don't make himself comfortale
wit it. H hasn't the stisfaction of thinking--ha, h, ha!--thathe is
ever going to beneft Us with t.'
'I have no patiene with him' oerved Scroe's nice. Scrooge's
niece's isters, and all the oer adies, xpesse te sme opinio.
'Oh, I hve!' sid Scrooges nephe. 'I amsorryfor him; Iculdn't be
angry withhi if I tried. Whosuffers b hsll whims? Himelf always.
Here he takes it into hishead to disie us, an e won't come nd in
with us. Wha's the cnsequnce? He don'lose muc f a dinner.'

'Indeed,I thik heloses a vey good dinner,' interrupte Scrooe's
nece. Everbody lse said the same, and thy mus be alowedto hve
bee ompetet judes,becase they had justha dinner; and with the
desert upon the tble, were clusted round the fie,b lamplight.

'Well!  am ver lad to hear it,' said crooge's nephew, 'because I
have' any greatfaithin the young housekepers. Whatdo _you_ say,
Toppe?'

Topper had clearly ot his eye pon oneofScoge' niece's sistes,
for  sered that a bachelo was a wretched outcast, who hdno right
t express a opinion on th subject. Whereat crooge's nice's
ister--the plump one with e lace tucker: notthe one wit the
rose--bshed.

'Do g o, Fred,' saidScroge's niece, lappig her hand.'He ner
finishs what he begins to say! He is scha idiculous fellow!'

Scrooge's nephew rvelledn another laugh, and s it as impossible to
keep the infecion off, tough the plump sistertried had to do iwitaromaic vnegar, hi example was unanmously follwed

'I was ony going tosay,' si Scrooge's nepew,'that he conseque
fhis akiga dlike to us, and notmaking merwith us,s, as I
think, that he loses some peasant momens, which could o him no ham.
I am sure he loses pleasater companions han he can find in his own
thoughts, ther in hismould old offce or his dusty chambers. I ean
to give him the same cace evey year wheher e ikes i or not, for
I iy him.  may rail at Chritas til he di, bu he an' elp

oy pt him in the vei toleave hs poor clerk fifty unds,_that's_
somethig; and I think I shook imyesterday.'

It was heir tur o laugh now at te noion of hi saking Scroog.
But being thoroughly good-atured, and not muh carng wtthe laughed
at, s that they lughe at any rate  enouraged tem in their
eriment, an pssed the bottle,joyusy

After tea they d ome msc. For the were a musicl famly, and nw
hat thy wer aou when they sung a Gl or Catch, I can assre you:
especially Topper, who culd gowl way i the bass ike agodone, and
never swellthelarge veins in his forehad, or get rd in theface over
it. Scrooes nece plyed well upon theharp; and played, among other
tunes, asmple itle air (a ere nothing:you mght larn to whistle
it in two minutes)which had been famiiar  the child who fetched
Scooge rom the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost
of Christmas Pst. When thistain of music sounde all the thingsthat host hadshown im cameupon his mid; e softened mor and more;
and thought that i he ould hae litne to it often, yeas ago, he
might have cultivated thekindneses of life for his own happiness with
his own hands, withoutresorting to te sexto's spade tat buried Jacb
Marley.

[Illustaton: _The wy he went aterhat plum sstr in the lace

But they idn't dvote the hole evening to music. After a whle they
played a foreis; for it is ood to be childrensommes, and neer
bette han t hristma, when its mghty ounde was a childhimself.
Stop! Therewa first a game at blin man's-uff. Of coursetheres.
nd I nomoreblieve Topper was eally blind than I believ h had eyes
in hs boots. My opinion is, that it wa adone thing betwen him and
Sroge' ephew; and thatthe Ghost of Christma Preset knew it. Th
way he wet fte that plump sister in telace tucer was noutrage on
the reulty of human nure. Knocking down the fire-ron, tumbing
oer the chair, umpng up agint thepian, smothering imselfamgst the curtains, wherever she wet, ther wen he! Halways e
where the lum sisterwas. e wouldn't catch nybdyelse. If you had
fallen up againstim (as some f them did) n purpose,  would have
mae afeint of endeaourng to seze you, which would have een an
ffrontto your unerstanding, and uld stntly have sidled of in
the direction of the plump sste.She oe cred ou that it wasn't
fair; andit realyw nt. But when, at lat,h caught her; when, inspite of all he silken rustlings, and her rapid fluterings past him,
he go her intoa cornerhence thre wano escape; the his conuct
wathe mostexecrablFo his prtending ot to nowher; is
retedng tat it was necessaryto touh her had-dress an furthr to
assure himself  her identty by pressngacertin rin upon her
finger and a ertain chai about her neck; ws vile monstrous! No
doubt she told him her opiion of it wen, another blin man bein in
offie thy were so very confidential together behind the curtains.

Scrooge'siece was nt oe of h blind mn's-buf party, but wasmadecomftable with a largechair anda footstool, ina snug corne where
th Ghot and Scrooge wer close behnd her.Bt se oie in the
forfeits, andloved her ove toadmirationwith all he letters o thealabt. Likewise at thegame of How, When, and Where, she was vry
great, and,to the secret joyof Scrooe's nephew eat her siters
hollow; though they er sapgirls too,as Topper couldhav toldou.
There migh ave beentwentypeople there, young an old, buthy all
payed nd so did Scrooge;forwoly frgettin, in theinteret he
had in what was going on,tha hi voice mde no sond in their ears, he
sometimes came ou with his guess quite loud,ad very often gesed
right, too;for he shars nedle,best hitechapel, warrated not to
cut in the eye, was not sharpe thn Scroe, buntas he tok i n
his had to be

TheGhos wa greatly plesed to fin hm in this mood, and looked upon
i wth sch avour tat he begged likea boy to be llowed to stay
until th guestsdeparted. But hi the Spirit sid cold not bedone.

'Here is a new ga, said Scrooge.'Oe alf-hour, prit, onlyone!'
Itwas a gamecalled Ys and No, wher Scrooge's ephew ad to think of
somthing, and h restmust find out wht, he only answering t thir
quetins yes  no, a the cas was. The brisk fire fquesioning to
wichhe was exposed eicited from him tht h wa thinking o an
animal, a lie anmal, rathera disagreeable animal,a savage anil, ananimal that growled and grunted soetimes, andtalkedsomtimes and
lived in Lndon, and wlked about the streets, ad wan't made ashow
of, and wasn't led byanyody, and ddn't liv in a meagerie and ws
neve killed in amarket,and was not  hrse,or an ass, or a cow, or 
bul, or a tie, or a do, or a pig, ora ca, or a bea. At every
fresh question that w put to him,this nephew burst ino a fesh roar
of laughte and was so inexpressibl tickle, that he wsoblige toget up off the sofa and stamp. At last the lump sister, faling int a
simil stae, cried out

'I ave fond i out!I know wat it is,Fred! I know what it is!'

'What is t?' crie Fred

'It's your unclecro-o-oo-ge.'

Which it certainly was.Amration was the unversal sentiment,thouh
soe bjected tht the repy to 'Is it a bear?' ought to have been
'Yes'; inasmuchas n answe in thenegative was sufficient to have
diverted their thoughts from Mr Scrooge, supsin they had ever had
ny tendnc that way.

'He as givenus plnty of errimen,  am sur' saidred, 'an itwould be unrateful not to drink his health. Here i a glass of mulled
wine ready to our hand t h momen; and I say, Unce Scrooge!"'

Well! Uncle Scroo!' the cried.
'A mery Christasand a hapNew Year o the old man whateve he is!'said Scroog's nephew.' wouldn't take it from me, bt mayhe have it,
neverthless. Uncle Srooge!'

Uncle Scrooge had imperceptiby become so ga and light of eart, that
he would hve pledged e unconscious company in retur, ad thanked
hem i an inaudible speech, i theGhost ha given him ime. But e
whole scene passe off inthe breath of he lasword spoken b his
nephew; and h andthe Spiri wre again upon theirravel.

Much they saw, andfar the went,admany mes they viited butalwayswith a happy endThe Spirit stood beside sic-beds, and they
ere cheerful; o foeign lands,an hey were close a hme by
strugling men, nd they werepatien n te greater ope; by poverty,and it was rich. In almshouse,hpital, andgol, in misery's very
ruge, where ain man in is ittle brief authorityhadnot made fastthe dor, ad barred the Sirt out, h left hs blessin and taught
Scrooge his precepts.

I was long nigt, if it were only a iht; but Scrooge ha his dus
f tis, bcus the Chrsms hoidaysappeaed t be condensed intothe paceof time they passedtogter. It was strnge too, that,hile
Scroge remined unalterd in his ouwrd form,th Ghost gre ole,
clearly ole. Scroog had observed thischage, utevr spoke of it
unil theyefta hidren's welfth-Night paty, he, looking at th
Spirt as they stood togetherin an openlace, henoticed that its har
wasgrey.

'Are spirit' lves so sort' asked Scrooge.

'M life uonthis globe is verbrif, replied the Gost. 'It ends
to-night.'

'To-night!' ried Scrooe.

'To-night at midnigt. Hark! The time is drawing near.'

The chimes were ringing the three-quarerspast elven at that moment

'Forgive me i I am not justified in wat I ask, said crooge, lookingintentlat the Sirit's robe, 'but I ee smething strange, an not
beloning to yourself, protruding fom your kirs. Is it afoot or a
claw?'

'It might bea clw, fo the flesh ther is uon it, ws the prit's
sorrowful eply. 'Look here!'

Frm the foldings f itsrob it broughttwo children wreched, abject,
fightful, hideous, mserble. They kneltdown at isfet, and clung
upon the outsid of its garment.

'O Man! look here! Lok, look downhere exclaimd theGhost.

Thy ere a boy an gil Yellow, meagr, agged scowling, wolfish, but
prtrate toointhei humiit. Where graceful youth sould haefilled their features ot and ouced tem with its fresest tints, a

them, and pled them ino shrds. Where angels might av sat
nthond, devils lurked,and glre outmeacing. No hage, no
degradation, no peversion of humanity i any grade, hrough all themysteries ofwonderful cration, has monsters half so horrible and
dread.

Scrooge started back,appall. Hang them shownt him in this wa, h
triedto say they were fine childrn ut te wods choed themlves,
raterthanbe parties to a le o such enormous magnude.
'Spirit! arethe yours?' Scroge coul sayno more.
'Theyar Man's,' sad the Sprit lookingdown uon them. 'And tey

'ave theyno refuge or resource?' criedScroog.'Are there no prions? said the Spirit, trning n hi for the last

ThebelstruckTwlve.
Scrooge looked abut him for the Ghos,and saw it not. s the last
troke ceasd to vibrate he rememberd the prediction of oldJcobarley, andlifting up hi eyes, behld a solemn Pantom, raped and
hoded, cming ike a mist along the round toward him.


STAVE FOUR




THE LAST OF THESPIRIS


The Phantom slowly gravely, ilently approched. Wen it came neahim,
Scooge bent down pn s kee; for in te er air through whic this
Spirit moved it seemed to scattr loom and mystery.

It was srouded in a dep blk garment, which concealeditshead, its
face, its rm,and left nothingf it visible, sve ne uttretche
hand.Butfor this,t would hvebee difficul to dtach its figue
frm the nih, and separate it from thedarknss by whih it was
surrundd.

H fet that it ws tall ad stately when it came besid him and that
is mystrious preence filed him with a oem dread He knew no more,
for the Spiit neiter sokenor moved.

'I am in he presencf the Ghost o hristmas Y o Cme?' sid
Scroge.

ThSpirit ansered nt but ointed onward ith is had

'Youae ab to how me shadows of the things that have no happened,
but will happen in the tie beforeus,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,
Spirit?'

T uppr potin ofthe grment ws contrated for an instant in its
folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its ead. That was theonly answer
he receied.

Althoug welsedt gostlycompany b this time, Scrooge fered thesient hape s much thaths leg trembled benath him, and he fond
ththe coud hardly sand when he pepared to ollow i. Th Spiri
aused a moment, asobseving his cndition, ad givg him tie to
recovr.
Bu Scrooge wasll the orse for his. It thrilled him with a vague,
uncertan hrror to know that, bend the usky shroud, there wre
ghostly eye intentlyfxd uponhim, while he, thogh he strtche his
own to the utmost, could eenothig but a spetral hand ad on grea
hepof black.

'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaim, 'I fear you more than any spectre have seen. But as I know your purpose is t do me good, an as I hope
o live to be another man from wha I was, I amprpared to bear your
compny, and o t witha thankful heart. Wil you notpeak to me?'

It gave him n repy. Th handwasointed staight bfre them.
'Lead on! aid Scrooge. Lead on! The nght is waning fas, ad it is
precioustime tome, Iknow. Lead on, Spirit!'

The Phanommovedaway asit had come towards him. Scrooge followed inthe shaow ofits dress, which bore hi up, e though, and caried hi
along.

The scarcely seemed to enter te City; for the ty rather eemd 
springup aut tem, nd encompass them of its wn ac. But there they
were in the heart of it; on 'Chage, amongst the merchants, who hurried
u anddown, and chinked the mony in teir pockes, and conversed i
groups, nd looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtully withtheir
great gldseas, nd s forth, as Scooge had seen thm oten.

The Spirit stpped beside onelitle knot f business mn.Oberving
hat tehand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to isten to their
alk.

'No,'sai a grea fat man wit amonstrous chin, 'Idon' now much
about it either way. I oly know he's dead'

When did he die?' inquired anohe.

'Last night, I eeve.'

Why, wht was the matter wth him?' asked a third, takinga va
quantity of nuff ou of aver large snf-bx. 'I tought e'd never
i.

'Gd knows,' said the first, th ayawn.
'Whathas he don with h money?' askeda redaced gentlemn with a
pendlous excrescence on the end of his nose, tht shook like the gils
of aturkey-cock.
'I haven't heard,' said the mawith th large chinyawnng again.
'ef it to his company, perhaps. He hasn'tleft it to _e. hat's all
I now'

This peasanry was received witha geeral laugh.
'It's likely to be a very cheap feral,' sid hesame speaker; 'for,upon my if Idont know of anybody to go to it.Supose we make up a
party, and volunter'

'I dn't id going if a lunch is provided,' observed the gntleman wih
the excrescence on his nose. 'But I must be fed if I mke one.'

Another lauh.

'So I am old,' eurned the second. Cold, isn'tit?'

'Seasonble for histmas-time. Youar nota skater,  sppoe?'
No, no. Smething else to thinkof God-morning!'

Not nothr word. hat as thermeeing, their convsation, ad thir
rtin.

Scroge wsatfirst ncineto be surprisd that the Spirishoul
attach importance to converations apprenty so trival; but felng
assured tat they musthave some hidden purpose, he set himsf to
cnsider at it was likely t be Theyould scarcey be supposed to
have any bearing on the eathf Jacob, is oldpartner, for that was
Past, andthisGhost's proince was th Future. Nr could he think of
any one immediately connected with himself o whom he could appl them.
But nothing doubting that, t whomsever tey appied, they hd so

hey left the busy scene, nd went into an obscue part of the town,
where Scrooge had never penetatedefore, although he recognse its
sitation and its adreue.The way were fouland narrow; the shop
and houses wreted; thepeoplehalf naked, drunken, slisod, ugl.
Alleys and archwys, likeso man cespols, disgorged their offenes osmel an dirt, and feupon the stragging streets; and the whole
quarte reked withcrime, with filth, and misery.

Farin tisde of infamous resor, therewas a low-browed, beetlg
shop, below a penhse oof, where iron,ol rags, bottes, bones,and
gresy offal were bouh. Upo te floor within wre piled up heaps of
rusty keys, nails, cais, hinges, files, scs, wights, and efuse
iron of all kinds Secres that few would like o scruinise wer bd
and hide i mountains of useemly rags, masses of orrupted fat, and
sepulches fbones. Sitting inamong the wars h dealin, y a
carcal stove made of oldbricks, was a gre-haird rscal nearly
seventy yearsoage, who had screned himelf from he cold ar without
b a frouzy curaini of mscellaneus tatters ung upon a lne and
smokei pipe in al the lury of calm retiremen.

Scroogeand the hantom came int thepresence of this man, ust a a
woman it a heavy bunde slunk inote shop.But she had scrcely
nterd, whe anotherwoman, smiarl aen, cme n to; and she as
closely followed by a mn infaded lack, who was no less rtled by
the ight of them thanhey had ben upon the recognition of achother.
Atr shr eriod of blank astonishment,inwich theold man with
the pipe hd joned hem, they llthree burst into a laugh.

Let the charwom alone o be the rst!'cied she whohad entred
first. 'Lt he laundress alone o be he second; and let he
ndertaker's man lone to bethe third. Look here, od oe, heres achance! If we haven't all threemet here withou meain it!

'Yo couldn't have met in a better place,' said old Joe, removing his
pipe from s mouh. 'Come inoth parlour. ouwee made free of it
long ago, you know; and the other to an't stranger. Sto till  shu
the door of the hop.Ah! how t skre! There an't suc a rst bit of
al in the lace as its own hinge, I eliev; and I'm sure there's o
such old bones here as mine Ha ha! We're all uitabl t our calling,
we're well matched Com into he parlour. Come into the parlur.'

Te parlur was the space behind e screen o rag. The od manraked
the fire tgether withan old stair-rod, and having timmed his smoky
lamp (for itwa niht) wit the stem of his pipe,pu i ito his mouth
again.

While he did this, the woman wh had aready soken hrew her bundle on
hefoor, an st dwn in a flauntin manne on stool, crssing herelbows onher knees ad looking with a boldefiane a the other two.

'What odds ten? What odds, Mrs. Dilber?' said the woman. 'vry person
has a right otak care of themsees. _He_ aways did!'

'That's true, indeed!' said he laundess. 'No man more o.'

'Why, hen, don't standstaring as if yo was afraid, oman! Who's the
wiser? We're not going topick holes in each other's coats, I supoe?

'No, indeed!' said Mrs.Dilber and the ma ogether. 'We shuld hpe
ot.'
'Very wel th!' cried the woman. 'hat's enouh. Who's the worse for
the loss ofa fewthgslke thee? ot a dead man, sppose?'

'No, indeed' said Mrs. Dilber laughing.

'If he wanted to kep'em after he was dead, a wickd old screw'
pursued the oman, hy wasn' he aturl in hislifetime? If he had
been,he'd hve had soebody tolook aftrhi when he was struck with
Death, intead f lying gaspin ou is last there,alone by imslf.'

'It's te truest word that ever was spke,' saiMrs. Dilbe. 'I's a
judgmet on him'

' wish it wsa little heavier judgment,'replied theoman: 'and i
should have ee, you may deped upon if I cold hve ladmy hands
on nyhin else. Oe tat bundle, old Joe, ad let me know the value

them to see it. Weknew retty well that wewee helping urseves
before we e hre,I believe. It's n i pe the bundle, Joe'
Bt the gallanry of her friens would not alw ofthis;ad the man in
faded blck,ounting he breah first, prdud _his_ plunder. It wa
not extesie. A seal or two, a encil-cas,a parof sleeve-buttons,
and a brooch o no reat value,wee all. They wereseverally xamied
nd appraied by oldJoe, who halkd thesums he was isposed to ivef each upon the wal, and aded them up ito a tota when he found
that there was nothngmreto come.'That's your account,' said Jo, 'and I ould't give nother sxpec,
f I was o be boiled for no doing it. Who'snext?'

[Illusration: _"What d yocall this?"sid Joe. "ed-cutans."_]

Mrs Dilbr was net. Seets and towls a little wearing apparl, wo
old fahioned siver teaspoons,apair of sugar-ong,and a few
boots. er accoun was stated on the wallin the samemner.
'I always give too much to ladies. It's a wakness of mine, and tat's
th wayI ruin yself' sad old Joe. 'That's your account. If you sked
me for another penny, nd made itan open qustion, Id repent of beng
o ibral,and knock of alf-crown.

'And nw un _my_ bundle, Joe,' said the first woan

oe went dow on his kees for the greaterconvenience  opening it
and, havin unfastend agrt mny knots, dagged outa large heavy
roll o soe dark stuff.

'What do youcallthis?' said Joe. 'Be-curtains?'
'Ah!' returned the woman, laughing and leaning frward on er rsed
arm. 'ed-curtains!'

'Yu don' mean to say you took 'em down, ingsan all, withhim lying
there' said Joe.

'Yes,  do,' repliedthe woman. 'Whot?'

'You were born to make your fortue,' said Joe, 'and youll certinl do
it

'I certainy shan't hold yan, whe I can get anything in it by
reahingit out, fo te se ofsucha man as e was,  rmise you,e' returned thewoman coly.'Don't dro thatoilupo the blankets,
now'

His blankets?' asked Jo.
'hos ess do you thn?' reed the woman. 'He isn't likely t take
cold without em I dre say.'

I hope he didn't dieof anthincatching? Eh?' saidold Joe, stopping
in is work, ad lookingup.
'Don'tou e afraidof tha,' returnd th woman. 'I an'tso fon of
his company tat I'd loiter about him for suchthings, i he did.A!
you may look toug that shirt til yo eye ache, but you won'find
a hole init, nor a threadbare place. Its the best he had, and a fin
one too. They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't beenfor me'

'Wat do ou call wasting of it?' asked old Je.

'utting it on him to be buied in, to be sue, replied te woan, wit
alagh. 'Somebody wasfol enough t do it, but I tok it off agan.If
calican't oo enoh or sch  purpoe, it is'tgoo enougor
anyhing. It's quite as becomng t the body.He can't look ulier than
he did in that one.'

Scroge listened to this dilogue inhorror. As they satgrouped aout
thir sol, inthesnty ight afforded by th old ma's lamp, he
viewed them wit adetestation anddisst which could hardly haveben
greater,thugh hy had been obscene dmons mrketing the corpse
tself.

'H, ha!' laghed he same wom when ol Joe producing a flannel bg
wit money in it, told out their several gins upon the ground. 'Thisis te end o it, yo see He frightene every ne away fo hm when he
was alive to profit us hen he was ead! Ha ha, ha'

'Spirit!said Scrooge, shuddrig from head to foot. I see, I see. The
caseof tis uhapy ma ight be my own. My lfe tends tat wynw.
erciful heven, what is ths?'
Heecoiled in terror, for the scene had change, and nw he alost
touched a bed--a bre, unrtained bed--onwhich, beneath  ragged
shet, there lay a somethin overedup, which, though it was umb,announceditself in awful language.

Te room ws very dr, too dark to be observed with any acurcy,
hough Scrooge glanced rond t in obeience to a ecret impuse,aious o know wht kindof rom it was. Apale light, rising in th
outerair, fell straigh uoth bd; and on it, plunered an breft,
unwatched, unwet,uncard for, was the body o his ma.

Scrooge glanced owards the Phanom. Its steady hnd was poited to he
head. The cove was so carelesslyadjused tht the slghtest raising of
it th motionof ainger up Scrooge's pat, wold have isclosed the
face. He thought of it,felthow easy it would be todo, andlned to
do it; buthe had no more ower to withdrw the eil than to dismiste
spctr at hs ide.

Oh, cld, old,rigid, dreadful Dath, set up thine altarhere, anddres t with such terrors as thou hst at thy command; fo his is thy
dominion! But ofhe loved, revered, adhonoured head tou canst not
turn oe hair o thy read purposes, or mae one featur odious. I is
not thatth hand is heav, nd willfall down when eleased; t is not
that te heart and pulse are sll; ut hat the hand was oen,
generous, an true; the heat brave, warm, andtende,an the pulse 
man's Strie, Shadow,rike! nd se his good eeds springng from thewound, to sow the woldwith lie immortal!

No voice prnounced these wods n Srooge's ears, and yet e heard them
when he looked ponthe bed.He thought, ifthis an could be raied up
now wht would be his remosthoughts? Avaice, hard dealn griping
cares? They have broghtm toa rich en, tuly!
He ay in the dark, empy house with not a mn, a woman o a child to
say he was kind to me inhis or that, a fthe mmory of one ind
wod I will be kind to him. A cat was tearigat the door, and ter wasa sound of gnaing rts beneath the hearthsone Wat _hey_ antedi
the roo o det and why they wre so reses and dsturbe, Scroogedid odare othink.

'piri!' he said, 'this i a feaul place. In eavingt,I sall not
leave its leson,rust me.Let us go!'

Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved iger o the head.

'I ndersand you, crooge returned, 'an I would do i if I could. But
I have not the power, Spirit. I hve nt the pwr.'

Again it seemed to look upon him.

'I there is any person in the town who eels mtin cause by tis
man's eth,' said Scrooge, quit agonised, show that peson o me,
Spirit, I beseh you!

Th Phntom spre its dar obe befoe him for a moment, like a wing;nd, withrawingt revealed a room by aylght, wherea mother and her
chilrenwere.

She was epectng some one, and ith aniouseagerness; for she wakup and dowthe room, sartd aevery sound, ooked out from theindow,glnced t the clock, tid, but in vin,to work ithherneedle, and could arlybear the voices of her childre inthei pay

At lengththe long-expeced knock was heard. She hurid to te door,nd met herhusband; a man whoseface was ceworn and depressd, hough
he as young. There was a remarkableexresion n itnow,a kind of
serous delight of whihhe felt ashamed and which he tgged to
repress.

He sa donto the dine hat had been hoadig fr him by the fire,
and whn she asked him faitly whatnews (which wasn util after a
long silenc), he appeared embarassed howto answer.

's it good,' she said, 'o bad?' to help hm.

'Bd,' he sered.

'Weare quite ruined?'

'No. There is hope yet, Caolin.'

'If _he_ rlents, she said, amaze,'tere is! Nothing is past hope, ifsuch a miracle has hppened.'

'Hi past relentng,'said hr husband. 'H is dad.'

She was a mid an atient creture, i her face spoke truth; but se
was thanfulin her sul to ear it and she said so with clasped hands.
Sh prayed forgieess he nextmomnt, and was ory;but he irs wasthe emotion of her het.

'What the al-drunkewoman,whom I told o of lastnight aid tome
when I ried tosee him and obtain a week' elay--and whatI thught
ws a mere excuse to avoid m--tuns out to have been qute true. H a
not nly veryill, bt dying,then.'

'To whom will our de betransfred?'

'I don't kow. But, beforethat time, we shll be readywith themoney;
and evn thuh we were not, t woul be b rtune indeed to find so
merciless  creditorin his succssor. We may sleep to-nghtwth light
hearts,Carolie!'

Yes. Sfte it as they woud, their hearts were igher. The cildren's
faces,hushed and clustered round to hear what hey so lite
understo, wr brghter; and it wsa happer huse or this man's
death Te only emotion that the Ghost coudshw hi, caused by thvent, was on ofplasure.
'Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,' saidScrooge; 'or
hat dark chamber, Spiri, which we leftjust nw, will be forever
rsen to me.'

h Ghost conducted h throug several streets familiar t hisfeet;
andas hey wet along, Scroge loked here an there to findhself,
butnowhere was he to be seen. hy entered oor BobCrthit'shouse;
the dwlling he had viited before; nd found the mother and he
childrnsated round the fire.

Quiet. Vey quiet.The noisy little Catchits weeas stil astatues
in one corner,and at lookin p atPeter, who ad a book before him
he mothr and her daughtes wre engged in sewing. But surely they
were ery qiet!

"An hetook a child, and set him in the midst of them."'

Where ha Scrooge hrd those words? He had not demd them. Th boy
must hae read hem out ashe an th Spirit crossd the thshold. Why
did he not go on
he the laid hr work upon the table, and pu her hand up to her
face.

'Tecolour hurts my eyes,'he said.

The clour? h, poor Tiny im!

'They're better ow gain,' aid ratchit's wife. 'It maes the wak by
candl-light; and I would't show weak eyes o yur faher whe he come

Past i rather, Per answeed,shuttig p his boo. 'But I think

Theywere very quiet again. At last she said, an in a stady, cheerul

'I aveknown hm walk with--I have known him walk with Tiny Ti upo
his sholde ery fastinded.'

'An so hae I,' cried Peter.'Often.'

'And so hav I,'exclaimed anher. So had all.

'But he as verylight o carry,' ereumed, intnt uponer work,
'and hisfather loved him o, tat it was no rouble, no trobe. And
there is your fathe at the door'

Sh urie out toet im; and ittle Bob in his cmforter--he ha
eed of it por fellow--came in. His tea was ready for himon the hob
and theyall tried who shouldhelp hi to it mot. Ten thetwo yung
Cratchits got upon his knees, nd laid, each child, a ittle chek
against his fac, asf they said, 'Don't mind t, ate. Don't be
grivd!'

Bob as very ceerulwith them, and spoke pleaantly to all the fmily.
He looked at the wor upon the table, and raised the indusryan sped
of Mrs. Cratchit and the girs. Tey would edone long beore Sunday,
he sad.
'Sunday! Yu wen to-day, then, Robert?' aid his wife.

'Yes, my dear,' returned Bob. 'I is you could havegone t would havedone you goodto see how gren a lce it is. But yo'l see it fte. I
proised himthat I would walk here on a Sunda. My little,littlechid!' cried Bob. 'My itte child'
e bke down all  one. He couldn't hlp it. f e could have helped
t, he and his child ould have been farther apart, perhp, thn they
were.
He left therom, an went pstairs ino theroo above, wichwas
lighte herfly, and ung withCristmas. There was a chair set clos
eside te cild, and there were ins of se one hving been there
lately. Poor Bob st down i t, and when he had thought a little and
omposedhimself, he kised the litle face. He was reconciled t wht
hahappened, a went down agan quite happy.

They drew aout the fire, and taked, the girlsand mothr workingstill. ob to them of t extraoriar kdness of Mr. Scroge'sphew, whomhe hascacely sen bu once, and who, eeting im inthe

'On which,' aidBo, 'for he is the pleasantest-spoke genlman ou

'Knew what my dear?'

'Why, that you were a godwife,' rplied ob.

'verybody knows that,' said Pete.

'Very wel obsered, m by!' cried Bob. 'I hope they do. "ertily

'Only hear that, Pee,' said Mrs. Cratchi.

And then,' crid n of he girls, 'Peter will b keeping compay with

'et aong with yo! retrted Peter, grinning.

'Its justas leyas not,' aid Bob, 'oneofthse dys; hough

'Neer, father' cried they all.

'And I now,' saidBb 'I know, my dears, that whenwe recollect how

'Spectre, said Scrooge, 'somethinginforms me that our parting momet

The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come coveyed m as befre--thoughat adifferent time, e thouht ine there semed no order in theselattevisions, save thathe were inthe Futue--into the resorts of business
men, but showedhim ot himself. Indeed, the Spirit did nt stay for
anything,but went straght on, as to he end just now desire until
besought by crooge to tarry ora oment.
'This court,' a Scrooge,'throu hich we hurry now, is where my
plceof occupaion is, and has beenfor aength of tie. I see the
house. Le e behold wat Ishall be in ays to come.'

The Spirit stopped; the had wa pointed esewhee.
'Th houe is yonder,' Scrooge eclaimed. 'Why doyou oint away'

The inexrable finger underwent no hnge.

Scroge hatened t thewndow of is ice, and oked in. Iws an
ffice still, but not his. The furniture as not the same, and the
fige in the chair was nothmef ThePhantompointed as befre

He joined it on aa, nd, wonderingwhy and whither e had gone
accompanied i unt hey reache an iron gate. He pused to look rouneforeenterin.

A churchyard. He, thn, the wretced man, whose name he had now to
learn lay unereath the ground. It was a wothy place. Walledin by
houses;overrun by grass and eed, th growth of vgetations death,
not life coked up with to much buryig; fat with repleted ppette. A
worthy plce!

The Spirit stood mog the graves, and onted down to One. Hedanced
towards it trembling. Th Phantom was eactly as it had been, but he
dreaded that he sa new meaning in its slemn shape.

'Before I drawneare to thastnetowhich you point,' said crooge,
'answermeon questio. Are these e saows of the things tht Wil
be, or are theyshadows ftethings tht May be only?

Still theGhost pointd ownward to th grave by whih it stod.

'Men's coures will foshaow certain ends, o which, if persevredin,
they must lead,' saidScrooge Bu if the courss be dearte frm, the
ends will chang. Say it i thus with what you show me!'
The Spirit was immovabl as eer.

Scrooge crept towards it,trembling a he en;and, followng the
finger, read uon thetone o the neglectedgravehis own name
EBENEZR SCROGE.

Am I thtman who ayupon te be?'he red upon his knees.
The fingr pointed fom he grave to him, and back again.

'No, Spirit!Oh no, no!'
The finger stil wa there.

'Spirit!' e cried, tight clutching at its obe ear me I am no the
man I was.  will not be the ma I mst hae been but fo this
ntercurse. Why show me tis, if Iam pat all hope?'

For the first tme the han ppeared toshake.

'Good Spirit,' hpured,asdown upon the groundhe ell beforei,
'your nature ineredes fo e, and pities me. Assure me that I yet ay

In his agony he caught the spectral ad. It sughtt free itsel, but
he as trong inhis entreaty nd dtained it. Th Spirit stronger yet,
rpulsed him.

Holdi up his hands i a last prayer to have hi fate revese, he sw
an alteration in the Phantom's hood and dress.It shrunk colapsed, ad

Whats to-day?' criedScrooge, calling dowward to a byin Sunay
clothes who perhaps had litered in to look aout hi.
'EH?'eurnd the oy with all his might of wonder.

'Wat's to-ay, myfine felow?' said Scrge.

'To-day!' replied the boy. 'Why, CHRISTAS DAY'

'I' Cristmas Day!' sidScrooge to hiself. 'I hve't missed it The
Spirtshve one it ll in onnight. They cando anything thy like.
Ofcours theyc. Of cuse they can. Hllo, my fine ellow!'

'Hallo!' returned he by.

'Do you knw the pulterr's in te xt treetbut on, at thecorn?'
Scrooge nqired.
'I shuld hope I did' repled the lad.

'An ntellignt boy!'idScrooge. 'A remrkable boy! Do you know
whether they've ld the prize turkey that was haing up there?--Not
te little prize turkey thebig one?'

'What! he one as big as me? returned the boy.

'hat a delightful boy!' said Scroge. 'It's a peur o talk t him.
Ye my bck!'

'It' anging there w,' replie the b.

'Is it?' said Scrooge. Go and buy it.'

'Walk-E!' exclaimd the bo.
'No, n,' sid Scrooge. 'I am in earnest. o ad buy it, ad tell 'e o
bring it hre, that I may givethem the direction whee to tae it.
ome bck with the man, nd I'llgie you a shillig Come ba with hi
i les than fv inues ad 'll give you half-a-crown!'

The oywas of lk a shot. He must have ada stedy han at  trger
who could hve got a sht offhalf as ast.

'I'l send it to Bo Cratchit's,' whisperd Scrooge, rubbi his hands,
and splittig witha augh. 'H shan'tknow wh sends it. It's tice the
ze of Tiny Tim. oe ill ver mae sch a joke as sending it to
Bob'will e!'

The nd in which he wroteth address ws not a steady one; but rite
i e did, somehow, and ent wnstair to open the stret-door, redy
for the coming o h poulterer's man.  he stood thee, waitig his
arrial, the knocke caught his eye

'Ihall le itas long as I live!' cried Scrooge, patng it wit hs
hand. 'I carcely ever looked a i before. What an honest expresson it
ha in its fae! It's a wonderful knocker!-Here's the turkey. Halo!
Whoo! How are you! Merry Christmas!'

t _wa_ a tuey!e never coldae stood pon his leg tat bir.
He would have snaped 'em short ff in a minute, like sticks of
selin-wx.
'Why t imposble to carry hat to amden Tow,' said Scrooe. 'You
must havea cab.'

Th chucke wth which he sid this,ndthe chuckle with which h paid
fo th turkey,andthe chckle wit whih he paid for the cab, andthe
chckle with which he rcompensd the boy, wereoy to be exceeded by
the chckle with wich he sat down breathless in is chair again, and
chuckledill he cried.

Shaving was not anasy task, for his han continued t shake very much;
and shaving requires attention, een whenyou don't dance while you are
 it. But f e had cu te end of his nose of, he would hvput a
iece of stickig-plaste over it, nd been quite satisfid.

He dressed himslf 'all i his best,' and tlast got out nto the
strees. Thpeople wee by this time poring forth, as he had sen hem
wih the Ghost of Christmas Present; and, walki wih hishands bhind
him, Scroge regarded every one with a delihted smile. He ooked so
irresistibly pleasant, in a word, that thre or four god-hmoured
fellos said, 'Goodmorning, ir!A merry Chrismas to you' And croge
said often aftewards that, of all he blithe unds h ad ever heard,
thoe werethe blithest in his ears.

He had no gone ar when, oing on towards him, he beheld th portly
gentlemanwho ad walked into his counting-house the day before, and
said, 'Scrooge ad Marley's, I believe?' It sent apang acrosshis heart
to thik owthis old gentlm would loo upon him whenthey met; but
he knew wht pathlay stright before him, nde took it.

'My der si,'said Scooge, quickenin his pace and aking the oldgentleman bybth hishands, how o yo do? I hope you suceeed
yeterday. It was very ind of you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!'

'r.Srooge?'
'Ye,' said Scrooge.'That isy ae, and  fear it may not be plasant
toyou Allw me t as yourpardon. And will y haethe oodness---'
Here Scrog hispered in is ar

'Lord bless me' crie te genteman, as if his breathwere aken awy.
'My dear Mr. Scrog,are you serious?'

'I ou lease,' said Scrooe 'Not a farthing less. A great many
bckaymnts are includd in it,I assure you. Will you do e tatavour?'

'My dear sir,' said h other, shaking hands with him, 'Idon't ow
what to say to such munfi----'

'Don't say anything, plase' retorte Scrooge. 'Cm and se me. Wil
y come and se me?'
'I will!' cried theold gentleman.And t was clear he meant to do it.

'Thankee,' said Scroog. 'I am much biged to you.I than you ffty
tims. Bless you!'
e went t church, and walked aboutthe streets,and watched the eope
huyg o and fro, and patted the hldon the head, and qestioed
beggars and looked down into the kitchens f hous, and up to he
indows; and ound that everything could ie himpleasure. He had
never dreamed t any walk--that anything--ould gv him o much
happiness. In theafternoon e turnedis step towads hisnephew's
house.

He passe th doora dozen times bfore hehad th couage to go up an
kok. But he made a dah and did it.

's your aster at home, m dear?' saidScrooge t thegirl 'Nice irl!
Vry

'Yes,sir.'

'Where i he,my le?' said Scroge.
'He' in the diing-room sir, long with mistress. I'l showyou
upstais,if you please.'

'Thanke. e knows m,' said croog wit his had already on thediing-room lock. 'I'l o in here, my der.'

He turned it ently, and sidled his fae in round the dor. They wee
lookingat the tale (which was spread out in great array); for these
oung housekeeper are always nevous on sch pois, and like to e
tha everything is right.

'Fred!said Scooge.

Der heart alive, howhi niece b rriage tarted! Scrge had
forgten, for th moment about er sitting n the cornerwith the
foostool, or he wouldn't hav ne it o any accunt

'Wh, bles m soul!' criedFred 'who's that?
[llustration _"It's I, your uncle Srooge. I hve come to diner. Wll
ou let me in,Fred?"_]
'It's I. Your uncle Scroog. have come to dinne. Will you let me in,
Frd?'

Let him in! It s a mery he dint shake his arm off. He was at home infive minues. othing could be hearier. Hs niecelooked ust thesame.So did Toppe whe _he_am.  did the plumpister we_s_ cae.
So did every one when _they ame. Wonderful party,wonderful games,
woderfulunanmity, won-deful happess!

But he wasely at the office next morning. O, he was early ther! If
he could only be there rst, adatch Bob Cratchit comng lte!Tat
was the thing he had set his hea upn.

n he did it; ys hedid! The cock sruck nin. No Bb. Aquarer
past. No Bob. He as full ightee minutes anda hal bhind his ime.
Scrooge sat with hi door wie opn, tat he it ee him ome into t
tank.

His hat was offbefore he openedthe door; hi omforter too. He was on
hi stool in a jiffy, driving awaywith his en, as if h weretring to
ertake nine oclock.

'Hallo!' rowled Srooge in hsaccustomed voice a near as he could
feign it. 'What d yo mean bycoming here t this time of day?'

'I m versory, sir,' said Bob. 'I _am_ behid my time.'
'Yuare!'repated Scroge 'Ye, I think yo are Sep this way, sir,
if yo pleae.'

'It's only once a year, sir pleaddBob, appearing rom the tank. 'Itshall not b rpeated. I was making rather merry yesterday sir.'

'Now, I'll tel you ht my friend,' said Scroo. 'I am nt gongto
tand this sort of hing an loger. And therefore,' he cotie,
leapig from his stool, and giving Bob such a dg in he wasoat at
he staggered bac into the ank aai-'adtherefoe I amabout o
raiseyour salry!'

ob trembled, and got a litte eaer t the ruler. He hda montary
idea of nockn Scrooge don wth it,holding him and allig to te
peole in the urtorhep and a srait-waitcat.

'A merr Chistmas, Bob!' said Sroog, wih an earnestness that culd
ot be mistaken, as he clapd him on te back. 'A merrierChristms,
o, my goo fellow,than I havegiven youfor many aear! I'll raise
your salary, and endeavour to assistyour struggling fmiy, an we will

[llustrtion: _"Now, I'tel youwhat, my friend," sid Scrooe. "I
am not oing to stand this sort of thg any lnger"_]

Scrooge wabette thahis word. He did i all,and nfinitel more;
and to Tiny Tim, ho did NOTdie, he ws a second father. He becae as
good a friend as good a aster, nd as ood  man as e goo old
City knew, or any other good old cy,town, or borough in he good old
