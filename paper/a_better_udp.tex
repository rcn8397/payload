% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  \usepackage{caption}
  \usepackage{subcaption}
  %\usepackage{filecontents}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsthm}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/



% *** TIKZ PACKAGES
%
\usepackage[svgnames]{xcolor}
\usepackage{tikz}
\tikzstyle{none}=[inner sep=0pt]
\tikzstyle{arrow}=[-latex,draw=Black,line width=0.75]
\tikzstyle{simple}=[-,draw=Black]





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

% to submit to, of course. )

This article describes an approach to improving the reliability of UDP.  Our
approach uses sequence numbers for datagrams to force in-order delivery to the
destination network application layer and error-correcting codes to help reproduce
lost datagrams without requesting retransmission of these missing datagrams.  The
level of data reconstruction will be largely dependent on the error-correcting
code chosen and the selection of its associated redundancy parameters.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
When a software engineer begins designing a
network application, he or she has to make a decision between
two transport layer options: TCP or UDP \cite{kurose2012computer}.
There are advantages and disadvantages to both.  With UDP comes
nimbleness and low overhead, along with dropped and possibly
out-of-sequence datagrams.  With TCP comes reliable connection-oriented
stream-based communication at the expense of throughput \cite{kurose2012computer}.
There is not much middle ground between the two.  The approach discussed
in this paper attempts to change that.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)

We do not attempt or intend to redesign either protocol.  Instead,
we seek to enhance the reliability of UDP, so that it is a little
more like TCP, while remaining quick and connectionless.  To do this,
we will require two added features to be built ``on top'' of UDP:
Sequence Numbers and Error-Correcting Codes.

The introduction of sequence numbers should be somewhat obvious;
on the receiving end of the UDP pathway, there should be someway
to put datagrams back in order.  The subtlety, however, of requiring
sequence numbers is that in order for our error-correcting codes
approach to work for the code we experimented with at least 75\%
of the datagram payload data must be available and properly
sequenced.  So, the inclusion of sequence numbers is really
twofold.

The second feature to be added, error-correcting codes or ECC, is a
little more complicated and requires more of an introduction,
if for no other reason than to get acclimated to the terminology
in the literature.

Given the no-guaranty and low-reliability characteristics of
the networking layer and the little added value of UDP,
a virtual communication link through a UDP socket represents
an unreliable, and potentially noisy, channel, making it
a viable candidate for a solution based on error-correcting codes.


\subsection{Error-Correcting Codes}
Above in Figure \ref{comm_link} is a block diagram of a general
communication link for sending messages \cite{clanton2005maa}.
Here the message is first sent by the \emph{source} to the
\emph{encoder} where the message is assigned a \emph{codeword},
i.e. a string of characters from some chosen alphabet.  The
encoded message is sent through a \emph{channel}, which is
certain to have some level of noise that may possibly alter
the codeword.  This possibly-altered codeword is then received
by the \emph{decoder} where it is matched with its most likely
candidate codeword, which is in turn translated into a message
resembling the original message and passed on to the \emph{receiver}.
The degree of resemblance to the original message depends
on how appropriate the code is in relation to the channel.\\

\begin{example}
\label{YES_or_NO}
Suppose we are using an alphabet containing only two symbols,
say 0 and 1 and we wish to send a message to a friend of either
``YES'' or ``NO.''  We first might consider encoding 1 for
``YES'' and 0 for ``NO''; however, if the codeword 0 is sent
and then altered by the channel to be received as 1, the
decoder will incorrectly pass the message ``YES'' to the receiver.
One way of improving the situation is to add redundancy by
repeating the symbol.  For instance, we might encode ``YES''
as the codeword 11 and ``NO'' as 00.  Now if ``NO'' is sent,
two errors would have to occur before the decoder returns
an incorrect message.  If one error occurs, then the received
vector will either be 10 or 01, neither of which is a codeword.
At this point, the receiver might request a retransmission.
This is an example of a code in which one error may be detected.
To strengthen the code to be error-correcting, we might increase
the redundancy by repeating the message five times.  Thus we
encode our message ``NO'' as 00000.  Perhaps the channel
interferes to cause the decoder to receive the vector 00110.
Using the method of nearest neighbor decoding, the decoder
assesses the message and decides that of the two possible
codewords (i.e. 00000 and 11111) 00000 is more likely the
one originally sent and hence is correctly decoded as ``NO.''
\end{example}




%\begin{assumption}
%Implicit in our example are two assumptions.  First, we are
%assuming that each symbol is equally likely to occur.  Second,
%the probability of an error is less than $1/2$. These are
%important assumptions to be aware as they will serve as
%guiding principles in the remainder of this paper.
%\end{assumption}

\begin{definition}
Let $\mathbf{F}$ be a finite set, or {\bf alphabet}, of $q$
elements.  A $q$-{\bf ary code} $\mathbf{C}$ is a set of
finite sequences of symbols of $\mathbf{F}$, called {\bf codewords}
and written $x_1x_2\cdots x_n$, or $(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$,
where $x_i\in \mathbf{F}$ for $i = 1,\ldots,n$. If all the
sequences have the same length $n$, then $\mathbf{C}$ is a
{\bf block code} of {\bf block length} $n$.
\end{definition}

Given an alphabet $\mathbf{F}$, it is consistent with
terminology for vector spaces when $\mathbf{F}$ is a
field to denote the set of all sequences of length $n$
of elements of $\mathbf{F}$ by $\mathbf{F}^n$ and to
call these sequences vectors.  The member of $\mathbf{F}$
at the $i$th position of a vector is known as the coordinate
at $i$.



\begin{definition}
Let $v=(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n)$ and $w=(w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n)$ be
two vectors in $\mathbf{F}^n$.  The {\bf Hamming distance},
$d(v,w)$, between $v$ and $w$ is the number of coordinate
places in which they differ:
$$
d(v,w)=\{i|v_i\neq w_i \}
$$

We will usually refer to the Hamming distance as simply the
{\bf distance} between two vectors.
\end{definition}

{\bf Nearest-neighbor decoding} is a method in which the
received vector is translated as the codeword of smallest
distance, whenever it is uniquely determined.  This method
maximizes the likelihood of correcting errors provide the
two assumptions mentioned above hold (i.e. probability of
an error $<1/2$ and each symbol is equally likely to be
transmitted).

\begin{definition}
The {\bf minimum distance} $d(\mathbf{C})$ of a code
$\mathbf{C}$ is the smallest of the distances between
distinct codewords; i.e.
$$
d(\mathbf{C}) = \min\{d(v,w)|v,w\in\mathbf{C},v\neq w\}
$$
\end{definition}


\begin{example}
The error-correcting code in Example \ref{YES_or_NO} is
a binary code of block length 5. The distance between
the codeword 00000 and the received vector 00110 is 2.
The distance between the same received vector and the
codeword 11111 is 3.  Thus, 00000 is the nearest neighboring
codeword.  The minimum distance of this code is 5.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
A code $\mathbf{C}$ over $\mathbf{F}$ of length $n$ is
{\bf linear} if $\mathbf{C}$ is a subspace of the vector
space $V=\mathbf{F}^n$.  If $\dim(\mathbf{C})=k$ and
$d(\mathbf{C})=d$, then we write $[n,k,d]$ for the $q$-ary
code $\mathbf{C}$; if the minimum distance is not specified
we simply write $[n,k]$. The {\bf information rate} is $k/n$
and the {\bf redundancy} is $n-k$.  
\end{definition}

Since $\mathbf{C}$ is a subspace, it follows that the
{\bf all-zero} vector must be a codeword in $\mathbf{C}$.
Also, the sum of any two codewords must also be a codeword
in $\mathbf{C}$.  We will also see after the next
definition that the distance $d$ is also easy to
calculate for linear codes.

\begin{definition}
Let $V=\mathbf{F}^n$.  For any vector $v=(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n)\in V$
set
$$
S=\left\{i|v_i\neq 0\right\}
$$
Then $S$ is called the support of $v$ and the weight of $v$ is
$\left|S\right|$.  The {\bf minimum weight} of a code is the
minimum of the weights of the nonzero codewords.
\end{definition}


\begin{example}\label{hamming}
Listed below are all 16 codewords in the linear $[7,4,3]$
binary code.  They are listed in order of increasing weight.\\

\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{cccc}
  0000000 & 0111000 & 1000111 & 0101101\\
  1100100 & 0001110 & 1101010 & 0110110\\
  1010010 & 0010101 & 1110001 & 0011011\\
  1001001 & 0100011 & 1011100 & 1111111\\
 \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Notice that the minimum weight is 3.  By Theorem 1.1 it
follows that $d(\mathbf{C}) = 3$.  It can be shown
that these 16 codewords form a subspace of $\mathbf{F}^7$
with basis $\{(1,0,0,0,1,1,1)$, $(0,1,0,0,0,1,1)$, 
$(0,0,1,0,1,0,1)$, $(0,0,0,1,1,1,0)\}$. Thus 
$\dim(\mathbf{C})=4$ as conveyed in the notation and the
redundancy is 3 since $n-k=7-4 = 3$.
\end{example}



\begin{theorem}
Let $\mathbf{C}$ be a code of minimum distance $d$.  If
$d\geq2t+1$, then $\mathbf{C}$ can be used to correct up
to $t$ errors.
\end{theorem}

\section{Design}
A Better UDP is ``wedged in'' as another IP stack
layer sitting between the transport layer and the application
layer, see Figure \ref{ip_stack}.  We did not modify any
kernel source and A Better UDP is not a standard yet, so
to use it an application developer or software engineer
will have to include this functionality as a library.
Instead of using a socket library to interface
with the transport layer, the engineer will link with
A Better UDP library to interface with the remainder of
the protocol stack which sits below the application layer.
Henceforth we will refer to A Better UDP as BUDP.

Messages, from the application layer at the source, are
passed to BUDP, where, currently, four at a time are
buffered, assigned sequence numbers, encoded to produce
an ECC, and then sent as datagrams via standard UDP to
their destination address. At the destination, the
datagrams are collected and stored in an accumulation
buffer, where they are placed in their proper sequence
(see Figure \ref{overview_schematic}).  The purpose of
buffering at the source is to support the process of
encoding the ECC.  At the destination, it is a requisite
part of the process since datagrams, presumably, arrive
one-at-a-time and the decoding process cannot begin until
a sufficient amount of the block data has been received.
Here, we say block data, because as we will soon see
datagrams have to be encoded in groups which we refer
to, at various places in the source code, as blocks,
for ``blocks of datagrams.''

One of three conditions prompts the delivery of messages
to the application layer at the destination:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item All four datagrams are received intact.
 \item Three datagrams are received as well as
       the ECC, intact.
 \item A countdown timer expires.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The first of these conditions is obvious, while
the other two require further explanation.  It is easier
to explain 3) first, so we will do that now.  As stated
previously in our introduction, we do not intend to rewrite
TCP, and we would like to keep our UDP implementation
connectionless, so instead of requesting retransmission
of missing datagrams, for example, when the one of the first
two conditions above is not met, our implementation will
simply give what it has to the application layer at the
destination.  Our justification for doing this is that it
is what a standard UDP implementation would do.  Actually,
a standard implementation of UDP would do less, because our
implementation will at least give the application layer
in-order messages.

%there is one benefit our implementation would
%have over the standard and it is that those
%datagrams that are passed up to the destination
%application layer are in order.

The second condition which can prompt message delivery to
the application layer requires the use of
error-correcting codes.  For the purposes of prototyping
our design, we used the single error-correcting Hamming
code introduced above which allowed us to benchmark
our implementation against both standard TCP and
standard UDP.  Our purposes for using this code over
the Reed-Solomon code suggested in RFC5510\cite{lacan2009reed}
were four-fold:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item It is simple to implement and suits our purposes very well.
 \item One of our co-author was very familiar with it
       and its connection to Finite Geometry.
 \item The [7,4,3] Hamming code is a perfect single error-correcting
       code, which happens to be the smallest perfect code,
       and is generated by a finite geometry known
       as the Fano Plane which is the smallest
       projective plane\cite{clanton2005maa}.
 \item Looking long term, we perhaps want to move
       our implementation to the newer so-called
       ``Low-Density Parity-Check Codes'' which
       have been beating some of the more recent ECC
       frontrunners such as turbo codes in competitions\cite{kou2001low}.
       Some of these codes can be generated from Finite
       Geometries, and those that are ``can be decoded in various
       ways, ranging from low to high decoding complexity and from
       reasonably good to very good performance''\cite{kou2001low}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Encoding and Decoding}
Encoding the message stream, using four messages
at a time, produces three ECC messages which are sent
seperately as follow-on datagrams.  So, at an overly simplified
level, the message stream, grouped in blocks of seven, flows like so:
$$ \cdots ddddpppddddppp\cdots $$ where $d$ is a data symbol
from the sender application, and $p$ is a parity-check symbol
associated with the four most recent $d$ symbols prior to it.
This represents an increase of 75\% in the number of datagrams
transmitted. These ECC or parity-check datagrams also contain
sequence numbers, which are a continuation of the sequence numbers
assigned to application data messages.  These sequence numbers
are used in the identification of these datagrams as containing
parity-check bytes. They are also used to identify with which
application data containing datagrams they are associated.

To use the [7,4,3] Hamming code, there are two very
important matrices required: the \emph{generator matrix}
$G$

$$
G = \left( 
\begin{matrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1
 \end{matrix}
\right)
$$

and the \emph{parity-check matrix} $H$

$$
H = \left( 
\begin{matrix}
  1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
  1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1
 \end{matrix}
\right)
$$


At the source, to encode a message $m$, which for purposes
of the math is represented as a row vector in $\mathbf{F}^4_2$,
multiply it on the right by $G$ to get $mG$, which is
a row vector in $\mathbf{F}^7_2$, where the first four
coordinates are $m$ and the last 3 coordinates are the
parity-check bits, or (as we have been colloquially referring
to them) the ``ECC.''  In RFC 5510\cite{lacan2009reed}, these bits
are called repair symbols.

At the destination, to decode the received vector $r\in\mathbf{F}^7_2$,
mutliply it on the right by $H^\text{T}$ to get $rH^\text{T}$, which is
a row vector in $\mathbf{F}^3_2$ known as the syndrome.  Next, syndrome
decoding is performed whereby a \emph{coset leader} $e$ is matched with
the syndrome $rH^\text{T}$. This coset leader represents the error vector,
which is the error between the received vector $r$ and the nearest
neighboring codeword $c$ to it. To determine $c$ simply add $r$ and
$e$ modulo 2. That is,

$$
c = r + e\; \mod 2
$$

\subsection{Encoding Scheme}

Figure \ref{simplified_ecc_scheme}
shows a simplified diagram of the ECC encoding scheme we implemented,
where `M' stands for message and the number is the datagram
sequence number.

There are actually two levels of ECCs that we considered using,
but decided against this due to the unnecessary redundancy
we felt it added.  This two-level scheme is shown in Figure
\ref{two_level_scheme}.  The level we implemented in the
one-level approach turns out to be an outer ECC in the
two-level approach as shown in Figure \ref{two_level_scheme}.
This two level scheme is very similar to the way CDs and DVDs
are encoded for error recovery\cite{kou2001low}.

The second level is the so-called inner or message level
ECC encoding.  This inner ECC would allow for checking and
restoring datagram integrity.  That is, if a datagram were
received at the destination and found to be corrupted, it could
be ``fixed.''  We felt this redundancy would never fulfill
its purpose since stock UDP (and, potentially, layers below it
such as Ethernet and 802.11 \cite{kurose2012computer}) already
provides a checksumming mechanism that potentially discard 
corrupted datagrams.

To make a scheme like this work, at least for the approach in
Figure \ref{two_level_scheme}, the inner ECC would have to have almost
as many parity bits as there are data bits in the application layer
message.  The reason for this is that in the case of a lost datagram
the outer ECC would have to regenerate the missing inner ECC, which,
in turn, would have to regenerate the application layer message data.
Our initial thought on this is that it will force a fixed-size
payload, so that the size of the inner ECC can be pre-determined.

With all the header overhead already inherent in the Internet
Protocol plus adding a sequence number and stream-level error-correction
codes, the actual application data might end up only accounting for
20-40\% of the data transmitted, depending on how the application
data is fed to the DUBP layer.  Adding a second level of ECCs
would only exacerbate this condition and provide little added benefit.

\subsection{Encapsulation}

Our BUDP datagram will be encapsulated in an ordinary
UDP datagram.  More specifically, BUDP will contain a
header including a field for the sequence number.  This
BUDP datagram (BUDP header + BUDP payload), will form the payload
of a regular UDP datagram.  See Figure \ref{budp_encap}
below.

\section{Testing}
\subsection{Method}
We have a fully functional implementation of A Better UDP
protocol which was written in standard C.  It was developed
on a few different Linux workstations and an Apple laptop.
Our code was version-controlled through the whole process
with tools offered through http://bitbucket.org.  The source
code along with wireshark traces is included with this submittal.
The code was written entirely from scratch.  This proved
challenging at times, but we are glad we did it this way,
because we learned about a lot of ``gotchas'' in our
sequencing and error-correcting design.

The receiving side of the protocol was implemented as a
state machine, which we like for its utility in exposing
the interworkings of what is happening in the various
cases of receiving, buffering, reordering, and error-correcting.

Currently, the state machine is not bug-free, but it is working
well enough to confirm some of our theory and predictions, which
we detail here.

Firstly, we planned to compare our BUDP benchmark against
TCP, but unfortunately the clock ran out on us for getting
this done in an apples-to-apples sort of way.  The test
environment to do this was a little more challenging to get
going due to the fact that we would have to standup some sort
of WAN emulator requiring three PCs networked together.  We
have those resources in the lab, but it takes a fair bit
of coordination to pull off.  So, we benchmarked BUDP vs stock UDP
and kept the test case simple and controlled.  We programmatically
forced every $4^{th}$ datagram to be lost.  That is, we simply
did not send it.  For BUDP, we still sent the ECC bytes that trail
the $4^{th}$ datagram.

Secondly, for timing each transmit session we used Wireshark and
did the transmission over the loopback address.  This turned out
to be a very test friendly way of doing things, besides recording
packets in sufficient detail.

Lastly, for transmission data we used text file, which contained
the text to the ebook ``A Christmas Carol'' by Charles Dickens
as it seemed appropriate given the season.  This file contained
189067 and is also included with our submission.  Hopefully,
this passes the fair use clause of copyright law.

\subsection{Results}
With BUDP, for every 4 data bytes we are sending 3 parity-check
bytes, whereas for stock UDP only the 4 data bytes are sent. Therefore,
we expected the transmission time for BUDP to be, roughly, 1.75
times greater than the transmission time of stock UDP.  This is
exactly, with in tolerances, what we saw.  Table \ref{timing_tab}
summarizes the timing outputs for both BUDP and stock UDP Wireshark
sessions.  The increase in BUDP over UDP represents a $1.765$
multiple.  The difference between that and the predicted $1.75$
could be due to the added bytes in the BUDP datagram for sequence
numbers.

Protocol & Timing (sec.)\\
\hline
UDP & 11.15\\
\hline
BUDP & 19.68\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Also, the [7,4,3] Hamming code provided the error-correction
capability we anticipated.  On the receiver side of the dataflow,
we wrote the received application
data (post error recovery) to an output file named ``budp.out''.
We used a tool known as \verb+meld+ to ``diff'' the BUDP output
with the original text and found they were identical.  Remember,
this includes forcing the sender to drop every $4^{th}$ data
byte.  Obviously, a similar ``diff'' between the stock UDP
output and the original file showed every $4^{th}$ text character
was missing.  This proves our assertion, in the beginning, that
BUDP improves upon UDP.

\section{Conclusion}
We have presented a design for a better UDP implementation
where datagrams arrive in-order to the application layer
at the destination and when a datagram is lost it can be
reconstructed, provided 75\% of the datagrams in its same
encoding block and their
associated parity-check bytes arrive intact.  If these latter
two conditions are not met, then BUDP simply hands over what
it has available to the application layer after a countdown
clock expires.  In this case, it essentially falls back
to a standard UDP implementation with the added benefit of in-order
datagrams.  This implementation requires the maintaining
of buffers at both the sender and receiver sides of the
communication channel for purposes of computing the parity-check
bytes, datagram re-ordering, and recovering missing datagrams.

Clearly, we need to do some more work on our implementation
as the thoughput timings compared to stock UDP are 75\%
higher, though this was anticipated for the code we chose
to implement.  We believe this design has a roadmap to better
timings while maintaining the same error-recovery characteristics,
with newer codes generated by finite geometries promising
to provide this correctability at optimal speeds\cite{kou2001low}.

Also, we find it interesting that finite geometry keeps
finding its way back into the discussion of optimal error-correcting
codes \cite{kou2001low}\cite{assmus1992designs}.

Finally, our view is that in order to deal with the unreliability
inherent in the Internet Protocol, a designer has to either build
in redunduncy to help clean up the communication channel or
has to build in a retransmission infastructure, as
is the case with TCP.  We prefer the error-correcting approach
as it is more elegant and mathematically interesting
and offers a path to an optimal speed protocol.  If in the future
such happens, we do not see why a designer would use TCP, or at
least we feel TCP would be used less frequently.
